There's really no way of winning. \nNot a huge fan of Thai food to be honest (*laughs nervously*) so I will have to say Italian cuisine. What's your favourite dish/cuisine? \n\nAahhh, Egypt must be extremely jealous :( I understand the location thing. \n\nJust went to work and took a much needed nap when I got home.

Before and after learning that is like that Traumatised Mr Incredible meme.\n\nMost of the time I go for bland food, like, the blander the better. Mmmmm, water! My  favourite cuisine is probably Japanese, they seem to be the most ready to serve me a bowl of saut√©ed veggies on rice haha. However! I love pineapple fried rice served on a pineapple, there's something so wholesome about eating straight out of a pineapple *slow Hawaiian music plays in the background*. But I also like fun things like dragon fruit (coolest name of any fruit), bamboo shoots, baby corn, nopal cactus, courgette flower, chayote, etc. Favourite dish might be enchiladas filled with a variety of steamed veggies, served on a bed of creamy, roasted red bell pepper sauce. I like Italian but I have a slight non-life-threatening gluten intolerance so I have to seek out gluten-free variations (sacrilege, I know), so I don't have it very often. What's your favourite dish? \n\nI can relate to just going potato mode like that! I always look forward to my after-work power nap üë¥. \nOn the weekends I like to write for a few hours in the morning and work on my music at night, so I'm usually back home by 9-ish.  My weekend evenings are usually improvised but I'm probably gonna be meeting a friend for dinner later, we were chatting about music yesterday and realised we haven't hung out in a while, he's also been working on new music recently so that should be interesting. \n\nOhhhh I could talk about music all day. I love classical music, jazz üêù, all kinds of pop, rock, \"alternative\", folk, videogame & film music, etc. My favourite composer is Beethoven, favourite solo songwriter is Mitski, fave lyricist might be Bob Dylan. My top albums are Is This It by The Strokes and Be The Cowboy by Mitski. I love STRFKR, Radiohead, Gorillaz, Deadmau5, Plenty (most underrated band ever!) Indigo La End, etc. I'll listen to almost anything though. These days I'm working on a sort of synthpop/indie pop album and an electronic music album. What about you, what type of music do you like?

It's so contradicting how nature can be so pure yet so harsh.\n\nI have never tried nopal cactus before but apparently Google highly recommends it, so maybe sometime :)\nYes!! Enchiladas are great! I like cheesy, creamy dishes, so pasta murdered with a creamy b√®chamel sauce, vetkoek (before I was vegetarian, vetkoek filled with chicken mayo or minced meat was usually great), nachos, sweet potatoes with cinnamom, portobello mushrooms stuffed with spinach and cheese, a Greek salad with avocado, grilled pita bread with caramelised onions + cheese + sundried tomatoes, melktert, sour cream cheesecake, hertzoggies...the list can go on for forever and a day üìú\n\nI'm very curious about your music, are there any songs released or do you do it for fun or still working on it to someday be released or...?\n\nI like the strokes too! But actually only know about 2 songs by them üòÖ I can also listen to about anything, except for heavy metal. I like indie/folk, indie rock, piano, some pop, synthwave, dark wave...and obviously sad girl vibe music or something that makes you want to live in a cabin in the mountains where it snows.\nSome of my favourite artists and bands are The 1975, NIGHT TRAVELER, Manchester Orchestra, The Paper Kites, Arctic Monkeys, CASTLEBEAT, Lord Huron, Kaleo, Cat Stevens, Alexi Murdoch, Cigarettes after sex, Noah Kahan, Hozier, Wallows, Freya Ridings, Patrick Watson, Novo Amor, SYML, Cinematic Orchestra, S√∏d Ven, Sleeping At Last, Bon Iver, Gregory Alan Isakov, Luca Fogale, normal the kid, Axel Flovent, Iron and Wine, By The Coast.",

That whole list sounds delicious. I looked up vetkoek and hertzoggies and both of those dishes look absolutely chef's kiss. The vetkoek looks a lot like something we have called \"pambazo veracruzano\" and the fluff factor on those is amazing, so I can see the appeal! I must try a safe version of the hertzoggies also, I love coconut. Fun facterino: I once went full Forrest Gump and kept a Duolingo steak going for either 1,110 or 1,111 days in a row for Dutch! I haven't studied Afrikaans, but I still found the name vetkoek funny, I knew it would come in handy someday! (I never reached any degree of fluency).\n\nYesss! And... not atm, haha. I've released a whole bunch of music over the years. I never much cared to distribute it properly (in retrospect, this may have been a mistake lol) but I'd put out a new album every couple of years under some random new alias and upload it to its own little website, repeat üòÖ. I think most if not all of those are probably lost to the sands of the internet, but I could dig around tomorrow/later and see what I can find. BUT anyway, I've been working on these 2 new albums since 2021. The pop one is fully written and produced, except for the vocals, all that's left is to record all the voices... for all 31 songs + the B-side üòÖ. I was supposed to do that through September at a studio but then I caught a horrible throat infection that checkmated me really bad! When I went to see my ent, he said my vocal folds were extremely swollen and advised vocal rest for a couple months, so I've pushed it back to Q1 of next year (no way am I releasing around December at the height of Mariah Carey's power, she's already defrosting once again! ü•∂). For the electronic album I've got somewhere between 20 to 25 finished tracks atm, those are all instrumentals though and most are pretty simple, not sure if that's your thing but I could share one.\n\nBut wait, there's more! \nI do have a few rather old (and almost embarrassing lol) song covers on YouTube, they're just for fun but I could upload a more recent one tomorrow. \n\nLet me know which one you'd like, funny song cover or original track, choose wisely! \n\nI'm curious about your hobbies too, if you'd like to share!",

Definitely resume worthy üòÖ totally proof for any company that you do not have commitment issues.\nYeah no one studies Afrikaans except South Africans üòÇ I think half the world doesn't even know the language exists. \n\nI would love to hear some of your own music! You wrote 31 songs for 2 albums? Damn that's a lot. Very curious what your lyrics are about :) Prepare to be psycho-analysed. No I'm kidding though. \nDamn that sucks about the throat infection! Just as I was about to request that you read Harry Potter to me the same way you read The Hobbit in your profile :( I was prepared to slip a dollar bill and everything. \n\nYou can definitely share an electronic track if you want to :) \n\nOoohhhh wait, I change my answer. I want to hear a funny cover song üòÖ\n(waiting for that knight ghost thing from that one episode in How I Met Your Mother to pop up, saying \"you chose poorly\") \n\nMy hobbies...I generally like outdoorsy stuff like kayaking, playing football, going for walks, water sports etc etc, but don't get around to do it nearly as often as I would like to due to the extreme humidity in this place the locals call Thailand. I also like artsy stuff like writing, painting (even though me holding a paintbrush should be illegal in at least 108 countries, and I'm pretty convinced that if heaven exists, I won't be allowed to paint there either), reading, and I want to learn to play piano in the future :) \nAnd then exclusively in my mind, I like surfing. But in reality I won't ever even attempt it. This thing called sharks you know. Oh and back home I used to love ice skating as well. Was funny to see people wearing helmets and knee-guards here in the ice skating rink. And I haven't seen a sign, but I am pretty sure they have a speed limit, and I am pretty sure it's about the same speed as the delicate crawl of a premature earthworm (she says in the least judgmental tone ever).",

I'm only missing Hallows but I'll get that when it's time to read it. I've read Philosopher's Stone so many times I think I can probably narrate the first chapter from memory hahah. That is to say, I will read Harry Potter to you in my audiobook voice any time you want! No dollar bill required. I would not say no to a vetkoek though.\n\nDo not worry, I have also commited crimes against the painting world in the past. \nI did not remember that \"you choose poorly\" episode at all, I had to look it up! \n\nYour hobbies sound super fun. I'm not gonna pretend I know the first thing about kayaking haha, but I've heard that New Yorkers bite more people every year than sharks do, so there's that. I've never tried surfing but it looks fun. I have this feeling that I would like to try snowboarding but I'm not too keen on breaking every bone in my body. Have you read anything good lately?\n\nI feel like you've just inadvertently changed the fate of the world by uttering the words \"premature earthworm\", it just sounds like it has to be a password for something.

And skiing too. The breaking bones part not so much, I have to agree. It's not even a proper battle scar that shows afterwards. Not worth it. \n\nHave I read anything good lately? Uhm let me see....yeah I read lyrics to a song someone sent me, which would have made Shakespeare ugly cry and convert to a different religion. \nAnd I recently finished reading We Were Liars by E. Lockhart, which was pretty good. The writing is fast and straight to the point which I like for novels. I easily get bored with a book, so it's hard to find something good. Planning on reading If We Were Villians next, but it takes a lot of internal persuasion to get myself to open a book lately. \nHave you read anything good lately? \n\nHahahah okay let's philosophize this. If the sky splits open soon, is it really my fault for saying \"premature earthworm\" or is it the premature earthworm's fault for existing? That being said, we can't really blame the poor worm for existing now can we? Is it then rather the creator of the worm's fault? Also, if whoever created the premature earthworm, created it in a manner that by uttering its name causes the sky to split open, then the creator itself has caused the sky to split open. Do you really want to blame the creator? Didn't think so. So why don't we just decock the blaming gun and enjoy the berries I went all the way to Sweden to pick?",

Thank you sooooo much!!! That you would even tangentially think of Tolkien is like the intangible equivalent of what the nose would experience if one were suddenly teleported to a strawberry field.\n\n\"it was a layer-cake only the rat from Ratatouille would be able to bake\" üòÇ *bows*. Most of my songs have never been recorded, so there's a lot more where that came from! \n\nI didn't study writing, I've just been doing it a while, about fifteen years maybe (if we're talking Music, then I've been writing since I was around 6 or maybe 9). This particular song I wrote at 3 in the morning (hence the last section) when I woke up from a dream and most of it came in a rush.\n\nOhhh no that second audio was because you requested a funny cover!! Sorryyyy, I  should've specified, that's \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the Room\" by Flight of the Conchords. I do write a lot of silly stuff but not very often in song form, hehe.\n\nHow have you seen HIMYM more than 22 times? (I love how you hyphenated that, btw). Did you just rewatch it in a loop? Is it your favourite show? What do you think about the ending? (I didn't rewatch the whole episode, just a ~2 minute clip of the mighty hologram-ghost-slash-knight)\n\nOmg how did you just know the perfect filling, I absolutely love berries! (they are, after all, the berries). \n\nYour bit of exposition on the New-Yorker-fearing villagers reminded me of the Discworld City Watch (I've only read the first one, a total crime!), really cool!\n\nHave you broken a lot of bones before then? One time, when I was very young, my arm broke in half like a Pocky stick. Pro tip: gravity tends to make things crunchy! *waves fist at Newton for inventing gravity* \n\nOmg stahp, even the Bard is getting flamed here, how am I going to resist writing you a piece of music now? *Schubert's Impromptu no. 3 op 90 by Kissin intensifies* (I had to stop writing my message here to go listen to it. I am bawling internally).\n\nOhhh I think I have that on my Wish List. I like that type of direct writing in novels too, especially in a thriller.  Hmmm, I finished Dungeon Crawler Carl about 3 days ago and I'm now almost done with the second book in the series. The audiobook is incredibly funny, it's got a lot of action-packed scenes and you can tell the narrator had so much fun recording it, he'll go all-out yelling like a sports commentator one second, then do a convincing female cat the next, it's LEGEN- wait for it... (but also the books are quite violent, gross and cruel, which is really not my thing at all, but it just works so well here that I can't complain) DARY.\n\nRight before that, I finished the Super Powereds series (Harry Potter in university with superpowers) but I had to burn through them at 1.75x speed because the prose is some of the worst I've ever read but the story is just sooo good. For my October starter pack I picked 4 Stephen King novels that I'll read throughout the month, though I also have a few Marvel audiobooks ready to keep the nightmares at bay *taps forehead. \n\nMy goodness! You went to Sweden and back, in the span of three paragraphs?! My most sincere apologies. Thank you, let us enjoy these delicious berries. *10 seconds pass* You make a compelling case, but let me join you in philosophising here: what if the concept of the worm does not actually matter and it was really about the phonetics being chained together in that order before the English language existed? As in a \"there is no way anyone will ever produce this combination of sounds, this password is totally safe!\". Also, we don't know how the hypothetical password-distribution system would work in this scenario, maybe they were randomly generated. If you create a random password generator, could you really be held liable for anything it outputs? So in that way, I believe I may be in the clear... and what do these passwords unlock, anyway? So many questions (specific sounds that unlock things in the natural world... there's a book in there somewhere, something something I should rip off and remix Ready Player One, Cradle and Percy Jackson).",

Well done creative genius, you have reached level 99. A new area has been unlocked. Skill upgrade available! Bonus stage unlocked. You are now one step closer to saving the princess. Power-up available. Health and mana regenerated. Intelligence, dexterity, and stamina has increased x5. Armour has been repaired. You are now unstoppable, however, your inventory is full.\n\nAhhh that is the best news I heard since someone told me that my praise causes steam to come from their windows. Layer-cakes are so much better to analyse than people, so I'm extremely glad you have an inventory of recorded songs. You are welcome to share whatever, whenever, only if you want. \nAh I see, I guess they didn't lie when they said practice makes perfect. They definitely lied when they said that you can't have your cake and eat it too, and that two heads are better than one, and that every cloud has a silver lining. \nYou wrote music when you were 6 years old? Dang it, usually kids eat grass at that age. Such a sophisticated little kid you were. It's really great that you knew from such a young age what you are passionate about and what you want to do in your life, it takes most people a very long time to figure it out. But you are really exceptional at it. Tolkien applauses you all the way from Middle Earth. \n\nOoohhhh, no problem! I don't know Flight of the Conchords, but now I want to go listen to the original song! \n\nI exaggerated a little bit üòÖ but I really have rewatches that show sooooo many times. Definitely at least 10 times from S1-S9. I watched it for the first time when I was like 10 years old I think, rewatched it during the school holidays when my cousins came to visit, watched it when I visited my brother after he moved away after graduation, watched it all throughout high school (even when it was 1 day before a big exam, and watched it again after the exam for comfort once I realized I never should have watched it before an exam), rewatched it every December holiday, every weekend after high school while studying, and I think the last time I watched it was after I finished studying and started working. My life consisted of himym catchphrases, inside jokes and parallels for so long. It is definitely one of my favourite shows. Others would be This Is Us & Prison Break. \nI know the majority of the people absolutely hate the ending of himym and how anticlimactic it was, but it was kinda obvious the whole time that Ted's wife would never get the amount of attention in the show that Robin got, so the ending was expected. His obession with Robin became annoying after some time though, especially when he planned on sleeping with Robin while he was still in a relationship with Victoria. Gosh I got mad at that. I almost stopped watching the show after the +-8th rewatch due to that üòÇ\nDamn sorry for all the himym ranting. \n\n\n\"They are, after all, the berries\" üòÖ\nI love berries too! Acting like it is highly unusual for two people to have that in common, but I doubt anyone dislikes berries. How can you dislike berries? I swear, people who dislike berries are the same ones who blame the chair after stubbing their toe and watch 'How to Pet a Rock' videos on YouTube.\n\nI wasn't familiar with Discworld City Watch so had to Google it, and man oh man, did the description give me vertigo. \"Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle.\"\nI can't decide whether Terry Prachett was extremely creative or extremely high on LSD. Nevertheless, it sounds very interesting! And that is \"interesting\" that stands on the back of \"genius\", which balances on the head of \"stupendous\". \n\nFortunately I've never broken a single one.\nOh my! What happened?? With you on blaming gravity already, but what happened? \nSpeaking of Newton inventing gravity...have you seen that video of the woman saying \"Like, if you think about it, we don't really need gravity, like, we were like fine before gravity was like invented. Like x100, like\" ?\nOr were you actually referring to that video? üòÖ\n\nYou shouldn't resist *smiles like Agnes from Despicable Me after Gru gives her a unicorm stuffed toy*\nAahhhhh I went and listened to it and I'm 100% convinced that that piano piece revived at least 48 people from the dead in Milan and 108 in Norway. It's soooo pretty! \n\nI'm also not familiar with Dungeon Crawler Carl, so went to look it up as well. It sounds really great! It's apparently humorous and he even travels through a dungeon with his cat! That is definitely going on my bucket list. \nI can picture it üòÇ*Imagining the most feminine meow catly possible*\nYou are one scotch on the rocks away from being the perfect Barney Stinson replacement. \n\nYou read 4 novels in a month? Dang it. Which 4 Stephen King novels did you pick? And on top of that there's audio books as well. You are on a roll mister. October is looking good so far. Aahhh wait is the Stephen King novels because it's Halloween in October? \n\nI usually make it to Sweden and back in 2 paragraphs, but I stubbed my toe on this chair and we got into this heated argument over it. The chair said some things it didn't mean, I said some things that I did in fact mean. Things got out of control, there were splinters involved. I had to analyse if I still like berries after the incident. Turned out I still did, so the journey proceeded. \n\nThat is a very interesting hypothesis you've got there Socrates *takes a puff from my pipe* very interesting indeed. Dare we discuss this matter with Plato, whose intellect often dances upon the precipice of pretension? To discuss or not to discuss- this is indeed a question worthy of our deliberation. \n\nThat's a very interesting combination of genres you have there. That combination of genres might be even more powerful than the combination of phonetics in \"premature earth....\" (won't make that mistake twice) \nI might have been responsible for the sky splitting open, but you, you will be responsible for a black hole sucking in all of existence. The consequences are inconceivable. Fine, do your little remix, but if I don't exist anymore after that, I'm blaming you.",

I am convinced that if the day comes when Looney Tunes stops making people laugh it‚Äôll be too late. Reject humanity, return to monke. \n\n‚ÄúNEEWWWWWW ACHIEVEMENT: Talk nerdy to me.\n\nYou have made someone implode with glee thanks to your sheer skill in wielding ~the vernacular~.  \n\nReward?.. +10 to Charisma.

Little has changed *chomps down on neighbour's garden*.  \n\n\n\n‚ÄúDefinitely at least 10 times from S1-S9‚Äù is definitely r√©sum√©-worthy, proof for any company that you don‚Äôt have commitment issues.\n\n\"Gosh I got mad at that. I almost stopped watching the show after the +-8th rewatch due to that\" made me lol üòÇ. No no, rant away! I have a nigh-unlimited attention span for media-related rants *as Darth Sidious: \"Good, good... let the hate flow through you...\"*. No but yeah I was not a fan of the casual undertones of unfaithfulness there either. Like, I get that it‚Äôs Barney‚Äôs whole thing, but Ted? Hmmm.\n\nI didn't hate the ending to the extent that I wanted to defenestrate the TV for delivering the message to my eyeballs, but I did feel a little underwhelmed (though I did cry a lot, obviously). I think I'd been expecting a huge twist for the ending ever since S7E12. I love that show so much, but it made me so sad when it ended that I only ever re-watched the first few episodes when afflicted with the Flu debuff and I needed comforting. Even though The Big Bang Theory is my ultimate comfort watch.  I‚Äôve only seen S1 of Prison Break, but I thought putting DB Cooper in the show was brilliant. Should probably give it another chance sometime.\n\nI totally understand about the catch phrases and inside jokes, I‚Äôm pretty sure about 20% of my verbal output is references to various media.\n\nDid you know the guy who started the pet rock business made $10+ million off it in less than a year? People will buy anything.\n\nWhat happened, you ask? I wrote a short story about it once *opens filing cabinet* I just looked it up, here‚Äôs an excerpt: \n\n\n‚ÄúIt had rained the night before, and there were still beads of dew pooling around the chipped blue paint of the rails - bad for the grip, specially with the sweaty palms of a six-year-old. I don‚Äôt remember what came first, the heat or the kid running away. Suddenly, some invisible man had taken hold of my neck and was emptying a can of compressed air into my nose, like a sneeze in reverse, hot metal. I felt my heart pounding in my head and there was a Polaroid haze to the moment, I was afraid the world would be pulled out of me. The heat, rising in my thighs as the crowd, the limb-mass, encroached around my vision. I was a stubborn tooth in a pair of pliers, those slow and overwhelming moments where your body is trying to tell you how handsomely wrecked you are, but your brain doesn‚Äôt want to listen. \n\nI don‚Äôt remember what my arm looked like then, just brief flashes. Heat, blood, a stranger‚Äôs arms, haze. With my head hanging limp off the side of my hero‚Äôs shoulder as she sprinted along the top row of the main hall, I realised that nobody in the agora had noticed the wailing scene in the playground. How I hated that music they were playing.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôll be looking up that video shortly!\n\nAhhh, I can‚Äôt say no to that mental picture! *falls to one knee, clutching his chest*. I am SO glad you think so too, I absolutely love that piece.\n\nI think I would make the world‚Äôs worst Barney Stinson replacement, but I will take that as a compliment! (I think).\n\nI picked up ‚ÄôSalems Lot, The Shining, The Stand and Fairy Tale. I have the audiobooks but haven‚Äôt listened to them yet. See, this is what I mean by my ‚Äòattack on my backlog‚Äô. Yessss, October is the month to get spooky! I want to try ‚Äúfull immersion‚Äù for maximum mental scarring potential *rocks back and forth holding his head*. Do you have any Halloween traditions? \n\nI am most devastated to learn about your stubbed toe. A parcel containing one small tube of healing ointment, a ‚ÄúDespicable Me‚Äù themed plaster and a get-well-soon card that reads ‚Äú ‚ÄôTis but a scratch! ‚Äù should arrive at your address by owl post soon, it may or may not contain a surprise gift. \n\nHmmm *takes a puff from my crack pipe* decisions, decisions‚Ä¶ perhaps Diogenes could hold the answer to this conundrum.\n\n‚ÄúWon‚Äôt make that mistake twice‚Äù üòÇ. \n\nDang, you could‚Äôve just said I sucked, but you went with ‚Äúa black hole sucking in all of existence‚Äù, brutal. \n\nI hope that a short story based in my little remix world comes to me tonight.",

You cried?! Damn, why does hearing that make me so happy? I'm not a sadist, I swear. Yesss, I can relate to that! It was extremely sad when it ended; I also took some time before my first rewatch. Aahhh The Big Bang Theory, also a great show. Have you seen Young Sheldon? Prison Break was one of those shows that made you experience the full spectrum of emotions in just one episode. It's emotionally exhausting and addictive at the same time. A psychologist is highly advisable once you've finished watching the entire show.\n\nWHAT?! This is a joke, right? Nah, I don't want to believe that. I prefer to remain delusional. How can he have made so much money from something so...?\n\nWell, for my 16th birthday, someone fetched a rock from their garden and gave it to me as a gift. No, they were not joking. No, they were not mentally challenged. Yes, they were in high school as well. And yes, they did, in fact, seem excited to hand me the gift.\n\nOmg, you can write about anything and make it sound like a New York Times bestseller. Gosh, I wish breaking your bones was like having chickenpox in the sense that if you had it once, you wouldn't have it again. And, of course, you would notice the music, even after breaking your arm. What music did they play?\n\nDo you know Yiruma and Ludovico Einaudi? Kiss the Rain by Yiruma is also sooo pretty! And Nuvole Bianche by Ludovico Einaudi is also soooo pretty!\n\nHahaha, you just pulled off the LEGEN-AND I HOPE YOU AREN'T LACTOSE INTOLERANT BECAUSE THE NEXT PART IS-DARY! But I highly doubt you're similar to Barney in any other context.\n\nOooohhh, so October is the month in which you mentally scar yourself so that you can repair yourself in December, right? Keeping nature balanced, I see. So responsible of you, and it's so much better than recycling.\nI think Elon Musk himself said that the best people have an audiobook backlog, so I wouldn't be too worried if I were you. In fact, you should add even more to the list.\n\nI sadly don't have any Halloween traditions. I have actually never celebrated it before. Do you do the whole dress-up shenanigans as well? I can imagine that if you did, you'd probably dress up as something obscure that takes people the whole day to figure out what it is, right?\n\n\"..and a get-well-soon card that reads \"'Tis but a scratch.'\" üòÇ\nThat is super nice of you, thank you so much! The Despicable Me plaster will heal more than the stubbed toe, believe you me.\nOoooo, a surprise gift? Is it a hard drive with 400 of your songs on it?\n\nHey, Socrates, can you blow some of that smoke into my face, please? My doctor said I'm only allowed to do second-hand crack.\n\nNoooo, where does the \"you suck\" part come from? I thought no such thing. Comparing someone's actions to a black hole sucking in all of existence is my way of complimenting people‚Äîa compliment of the highest ranks. \n\nBtw, \"applauses\"? What was I thinking in my previous text? I obviously meant \"applauds\". I shall slowly take 2 steps back from the edge of the bridge I was about to jump from when I read that.",

It‚Äôs ok, you can sob. \n\n(Un?)fortunately, not a joke. Such is the power of memes! \n\nI've planned to watch Young Sheldon about 73 times but never got around to it. This might have something to do with my never actually finishing TBBT (I didn't watch the last few episodes) so that I can delude myself into feeling like the story never ended. A couple times I‚Äôve dreamt whole new episodes. \n\nDo you ever have lucid dreams? What do you do in them? I usually summon a suit of Iron Man armour and fly around. Though I must confess, one time I was grocery shopping in my dream (I know) and then I gained lucidity and decided to roller-skate around whilst thrashing the place. I think I was probably in a video game that gave me points for every thing I kicked. Please don‚Äôt psychoanalyse that.  No, there were no babies in the dream.\n\nSo many questions... did the rock get this person a date, and what kinds of rocks do you like? *Takes notes*. Maybe they just really really liked penguins? That's how emperor penguins court their love interest, males have to find and present the BEST pebble, which is usually surprisingly round looking, and you can‚Äôt just find something like that lying around nearby. Those penguins sure go the extra mile. \n\n*Extreme Japanese bow* thank you once again. *Presents you with even more Despicable Me plasters*\n\n~~~*Puts on writing glasses*\nI was at a school festival the day I broke my arm, the loudspeakers in the main hall screamed the kind of fake-happy m√©lange that is the exclusive domain of kids parties and political rallies. \n~~~\n\nI‚Äôm not sure what song it was, but imagine a type of Backstreet Boys turbo-megamix 3000, like the Lucky Charms guy and the Cocoa Puffs bird started a meth business and this was their first test subject‚Äôs musical output.\n\nBy the way, I watched that video with the girl saying Newton invented gravity and I feel like I lost 1% brainpower. I already don‚Äôt remember most of it, I think my brain is trying to delete it.\n\nI went to YouTube instead of a streaming service to listen to Kiss the Rain and opened the comments and unsurprisingly it was all ‚Äúmy dog used to play us this song every day‚Äù type comments. Why, YouTube, why. *Suddenly transmogrifies into Youtuber, manifests  studio lighting* \n\"The piece is very pretty indeed. It's structured around a classic ≈çd≈ç shink≈ç progression. The main theme is similar in setup to 'A Tender Feeling' by Yuki Kajiura, but the payoff is completely different. It's giving desolation, it's giving the big saddies. Let me know what you think in the comments‚Äù \n*transmogrifies back*. \nNuvole Bianche is really pretty also! Thank you for sharing!\n\nAhh you get it. It‚Äôs all about that healing *sniffs* when winter comes around with its cold winds and its warm embrace. I hope the audiobook thing is correct because I have a little under 250 titles sitting in my backlog right now hahah, I don't know that I should be adding more, but most likely we'll have sales in the next few months and the cycle will continue. \n\nAhhh *puts on deerstalker hat* I deduce you grew up in... South Africa (impressive, right?). I would say it‚Äôs a pretty big deal here, so much so that we kind of have it two days in a row, first Halloween and then the Day of the Dead. Enthusiasm around Halloween varies by state/city/neighbourhood/person, but in my area you always see kids (and sometimes adults going door to door as well, in suspiciously intricate costumes, under the guise of chaperones)  trick or treating. They'll even say \"trick or treat\" (albeit usually in Spanish) and I've even seen groups sing little Halloween songs in English, which feels like being transported to an episode of the Twilight Zone. I greatly enjoy Halloween, even though I‚Äôm not big into horror. \n\nOne universally loved thing about Day of the Dead is a type of bread you can only find in October, maybe up to the second week of November. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòPan de Muerto‚Äô (Bread of the Dead) and that‚Äôs about as badass a name as a bread can have.\n\nHmmm, I‚Äôve never been particularly adept at that type of crafts, so I don‚Äôt go for the dress-up shenanigans, except that time I picked out an outfit that was an almost exact match of Martin Freeman‚Äôs John Watson‚Äôs.\n\nYou are most welcome! I was thinking chocolate but the hard drive could be arranged as well. I reckon it‚Äôd probably take me around a year to write you 400 songs though. üé∂Depending on the songs.\n\nYour doctor is very wise! *Blows crack smoke into your face*.\n\nOhhh, my apologies then! I must in turn compliment your skill in complimenting people, truly an exquisite talent, I‚Äôm going to hire you to write the fake Amazon reviews of my debut novel.\n\nAh, that‚Äôs unfortunate, but I applause the effort. My mind replayed the scene from Yes Man where Jim Carrey sings Jumper by Third Eye Blind. \n\nI didn‚Äôt hear the story based on my world in my head last night, but I started writing one that seems to have legs!

Also, permission granted to dream whole new episodes for himym. By the way, have you ever watched The Office? I know it's quite renowned, but I never watched more than a few episodes. It's just soooo tedious. The type of humor is repetitive, which is kind of the same for most sitcoms.

I'm going to keep that in mind tonight if I dream. Summon a suit of armor and fly, Karla! Grocery shopping in your dream? üòÖDamn, your dreams are exciting! (I once dreamed in black and white.) I would never even have thought about you kicking babies if you hadn't mentioned it. But roller skating in a grocery store sounds so '70s, and now that's all I will ever think about when I go grocery shopping. The only part of that paragraph I psychoanalyzed is the part where you trash things, which means you are probably not OCD. So, nothing bad.\n\nNope, the rock did not get this person a date, as the person was a girl üòÖ I generally like the rock that David used to K.O. Goliath or the stone that King Arthur pulled the sword from. But you know, I'm easygoing, so I will also accept the Blarney Stone or Plymouth Rock. \nThat is SO FREAKING CUTE, THOUGH! Penguins wooing the females with pebbles! ü•π So innocent. It makes me think of swans that mate for life and become depressed when their partner passes away (Penguins too. Some other animals as well, actually.)\n\nüòÇSo many things I will never look at the same again. *Imagines a future reality, eating Cocoa Puffs and getting into a heated argument as to why the bird dared to get involved in a meth business.

Hey, if you finished reading book #12, you can technically say you've been divorced before. \n*stares into the vast distance, trying to comprehend how‚Äîand, more importantly, why‚ÄîI came to the topic of divorce*\n*insert piano music equivalent to \"Everything is fcked\" by Mark Manson*\n\nReading two books in two days is very impressive, dang. \nFor me, it doesn't necessarily depend on whether it was a long-running series or not, if I connected with the story, then reaching the end is always difficult. I'd say during the last chapter, I would close the book and get up to do something unimportant several times to create some distance.\nAnd once the book is finished, I naturally lie there, mentally, emotionally, and physically paralyzed and depersonalized.\n\nYou were stuck in an elevator with some of the world's brightest minds (using the term a bit loosely there, though), and Howard, and you didn't ask them about the missing baryon problem, or consciousness, or dark matter? How dare you? This will go into your simology as well, mister.\n*insert Sims theme song while NPC stands panicking in front of a stove that has caught fire without extinguishing it*\n\nNoooo, not the bombastic side-eye! Okay, you know what? I will skip season 1 as well and start watching it from season 2 tonight and tell you what I think of it in my next message. Okay? Okay! But then, this is a formal request for you to retract your bombastic side-eye, please.\n\nI 100% agree with you. Sitcoms are the only things I watch after work during the week, despite being bored into a vegetative state by rewatching the same ones over and over again. But I just don't have the mental energy to watch anything else. Wait, hold up there, sergeant. The Office is in your list of top favorite shows??! Okay, this just got real. Now I HAVE to find something that I like about it, even if it‚Äôs just the lighting or their office desk designs. \n\nThe Thick of It looks interesting. I absolutely love British humour!\nTrial and Error also looks interesting! It's always refreshing to watch John Lithgow do his thing (low-key despise him for studying at Harvard though).\nLavinia Peck-Foster \"is giving\" Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. Parks and Recreation also has great actors, even though I've never watched the show but have heard of it, of course. Nick Offerman has this vibe that he owes the mafia money and sharpens his knives on his belt buckle, but that he also secretly just wants a quiet life in the mountains, spending his time gardening and creating new fertilizers. Definitely a distant family member of the Dursleys.\n\n*Runs faster than the Road Runner, almost on the verge of breaking the space-time continuum, and grabs Tipp-Ex to erase the part where you said, \"....when I die.....\"*\n\nSadly, I did not. I was as grounded as an object can be. I actually don't remember my dreams lately. Getting old is not as fun as Meryl Streep makes it look.\n*looks suspiciously at the guy blinking 27 times and kindly asks him to select all pictures with a traffic light*\n\n*Plot twist: the bald guy is a high-profile kleptomaniac that I hired to steal the Philosopher's Stone from you (\"I know, continuity error ü§´\").*\nThat is the only reason that makes sense to me as well. That, and if they thought of a crow/raven when they called you that. \n\nOh, well, for the sake of math, I shall give you the exact coordinates of that asylum: 20¬∞56'15.95\"S 164¬∞39'30.15\"E.\n*glances up at the sky to check if Pythagoras took note that I acted in favour of math*\n(*correction: stares down into hell to check if Pythagoras took note that I acted in favour of math*)\n\nAh, gambling with death there, I see. If it ever so happens that AI actually takes over the world one day, *knocks on wood twice and goes to a random site just to accept all cookies*, you will be the first person they seek out. I can't even imagine the type of torture they will give you: 30-minute long advertisements after every 2 minutes of The Office, having to pay subscription fees for every single item that you want to eat/drink, and having to do a four-hour tutorial on \"How to stand in line for a ticket to the next line\" every morning when you wake up.\n\nFor the sanity of my own mind, I shall refer to it from now on as Spider-Man Bread as opposed to Xenomorph Bread. Actually, I shall travel to East Africa to find a member of the Maasai Tribe and ask them to teach me how to dance around a fire and pray to the universe to erase the memory of ever having knowledge of what a xenomorph is.\n\n*reports üö© your comment on YT as \"promotes terrorism\"*\n\nAhhhh, I get it now. While I'm dancing with the Maasai Tribe for memory loss, I shall also ask the universe to grant a 100% discount on audiobooks for you, indefinitely! Any other requests while we're trying to perform miracles?\n\nI'd love to see the:\nüïµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è...\nüïµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è...\nüïµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èü™©üï∫üï∫!\nturn into a saga.\n\n\"YT: Squirrel fakes crime scene üòÇ\"\n*Rapidly tears open the plasters to put on your fingers while sympathizing with your pain in a voice used only when talking to puppies*\nYes, yes, he sounds like an amazing gentleman indeed. *insert iconic nodding scene of Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson*\n\n\nThat's a lot of writing in just one day‚Äîthree whole songs. At this point, you are probably your own qualified psychologist. And I assume you are a perfectionist when it comes to your writing since you scrap most of them? Do you think that, instead of scrapping them, you should keep them in case you see them from a different angle in the future and realize that maybe they were actually great all along? I mean, Stephen King threw away his first draft of Carrie before his wife saved it from the trash and convinced him to continue writing it. You might have written an \"Iris\" by Goo Goo Dolls without even knowing it.\n\n*Capitalism intensifies* üòÇ\n\nThat is Beatles information that I didn't know I needed until I can't imagine a world in which I didn't know it. Thank you for blessing my ears (mentally corrects it to \"eyes\") with that knowledge.\n\nI could experience your panic to share your story with all five of my senses. You really don't have to share anything if you don't feel comfortable, even if I ask üòÖ. Just say, \"possum snout,\" and I will fully understand.\n\nYour story sounds hella interesting!!! No need to panic. *pulls out a beach chair and palm leaf and starts fanning you. Egyptian music spontaneously starts playing in the background.*\nI'm already curious about the dangerous thing that he learned!\nAlso, finger pattern locking my mind to keep him out of it.",

Fear not, I have already bribed the cricket to let you win, he‚Äôs leaping off the ring in the third round, his family will get ten bushels of alfalfa. \n\n*frantically starts doing in-depth research about coffee* \nThe inclusion of sour worms speaks to your most distinguised taste, as was to be expected. Few can appreciate the complex flavour profile of olives and the depth of their more subtle notes *wolfs down bag of olives and collapses from sodium overload*.   \n \nMy favourite socially-acceptable-but-rarely-consumed snacks when watching movie are vanilla ice cream and gluten-free vanilla cookies in a glass of vanilla-flavoured almond milk. Also m&m‚Äôs, olives and nachos that have been mega-drenched in nacho cheese. I‚Äôm more of a main-course-whilst-watching-movie type of person, but the more snackable ones would be some vanilla-flavoured greek yogurt topped with puffed amaranth, and perhaps a plate of mini quesadillas. \n\nI must confess I have never played the Sims myself *flinches in case you throw a stapler* I may be in need of indoctrination. In case that‚Äôs your way of asking, *slaps roof of self* I've never been divorced, never been engaged and I only have nine children. I haven‚Äôt read Mark Manson‚Äôs books so you‚Äôre gonna have to help me out here, the book cover ‚Äúis giving‚Äù Mad World by Gary Jules.\n\n‚ÄúAnd once the book is finished, I naturally lie there, mentally, emotionally, and physically paralyzed and depersonalized.‚Äù üòÇ I can relate, the hour immediately following the last page of a story is like having to stare at a loading screen while you cross out of existential limbo. \n\n*Pulls out UNO reverse card*\nMaybe upon gaining lucidity I‚Äôd become aware that any information they could‚Äôve given me was restricted to things I already knew. Checkmate, Miss. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure what Sims theme song you meant, so I listened to each main theme of all four games, but none of them sounded very stove-on-fire like. So then I went and watched the intros and finally, the first Sims intro animation is the only one that features a woman attempting to use a fire extinguisher on a stove  that‚Äôs clearly about to explode, BUT the music is not the same as the official Theme Song‚Ä¶ quite the mystery üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è.\n\nI hereby formally retract the previously joked about bombastic side-eye. 'Twas but a jab.\n\nPlease tell me one of your favourite shows that you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like so that I can watch the first episode tonight, I can‚Äôt let you suffer alone.\n\nI have recommended The Thick Of It to three individuals before and none of them liked it üòÇ. I find it hilarious! John Lithgow is an incredible actor, he‚Äôs so good in that show too. What did Harvard do to earn your wrath?  Or rather, which one of their scandals are you referring to?\n\nYou‚Äôre not too far off about Nick Offerman, he basically plays himself in Parks & Rec, very into carpentry and axes and that type of thing.  \n\nThank you for that, I needed that. *I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing stars playing*\n\nTo be fair, I doubt even Meryl Streep can compare to Meryl Streep. No, not the traffic lights again *sweats profusely*.\n\nHave you ever befriended a crow, raven or any other corvid?\n\nAssembling a crow army is a personal aspiration of mine. It is crazy to me how nobody has gone full Pixar villain by investing a lot of time, effort and money to gain the backing of all the crows in their general location (ü´° General Location!). I have a theory that having the backing of all the crows in a specific region could be life-saving if one finds themselves lost in the wilderness with no means of reaching human civilisation. This is because all the crows would merge together into a Godzilla sized crow and fly you to safety *taps forehead*. I really want to meet a raven. I think corvids are 10/10 animals. \n\nMaths can be so beautiful sometimes *checks himself into asylum*.\n\nVery Solid Pythagorean joke. \n\nI‚Äôd never thought about the cookie situation, what if they start asking you to accept the chocolate chip cookies? So many would give in. Only the strong of will and the gluten intolerant shall resist the allure of the cookies.\n\n\"How to stand in line for a ticket to the next line\" is a more harrowing thought than most horror stories. Joke's on them though, I am prepared to procure The Office in Blu-Ray format on the black market if it comes down to it, also I have as few subscription services as possible. I say let them try, I‚Äôll be waiting for them with my slingshot (I have allied myself with the emperor penguins, they have provided me with all their discarded pebbles).\n\n\" *reports üö© your comment on YT as \"promotes terrorism\"* \" üòÇüòÇ \n\nI just spent a good while reading about the Maasai Tribe and the thing I need to mention is that they worship a god called Enkai. In Japanese, an enkai means a dinner party. Can you imagine the misunderstanding if a Japanese person wanted to invite them all to dinner? There‚Äôs a story there somewhere, but I will not go looking for it today. \n\nWhat happens if you forget the dance for memory loss, mid-dance? Do you get super memory? \n\nI am in your debt, you really shouldn‚Äôt have used your wish to grant me infinite audiobooks! I shall now embark on a quest to procure the best coffee in the world for you (whilst listening to my new audiobooks, of course).\n\nHmmmm, I do have one other request while we‚Äôre trying to perform miracles, but I don‚Äôt want to jinx it. \n\nYou can‚Äôt just say that and not provide more details about this üïµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èü™©üï∫üï∫saga!\n\nAhhh that‚Äôs much better, thank you so much!!!\nPuppies are awesome so I‚Äôll take it.\n\nNow I need to watch Jeremiah Johnson because I've been referencing that GIF for years. \n\nYou raise a very good point. Did the fire dance grant you mind-reading powers? Because I always talk about Stephen King throwing away the first draft of Carrie before his wife saved it from the trash and convinced him to keep writing it. *Grabs head* I need to take this chance to plug \"On Writing: A memoir of the craft\", where he talks about that whole thing in depth and how his wife helped him proofread it. \n\nI don‚Äôt think I am perfectionist, and if I was I wouldn‚Äôt like to think so, because ‚Äúperfect is the enemy of good‚Äù. I think my reason for scrapping most of my work is that I don't want to ‚Äùdilute\" my catalogue. When I find an artist I like, I'll go and listen to their releases in chronological order, and a lot of the times a good chunk of their material will feel comparatively mediocre, soon it goes from \"these guys are good!\" to humming their one good song but not remembering the band's name. \n\nI possess vast swaths of music trivia, it‚Äôs always my pleasure to provide useless commentary. \n\nYou‚Äôll get no possum snouts from me! I was just trolling you with the suspense hahah. I live by the words ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT PANIC‚Äù and I‚Äôm notoriously hard to make uncomfortable, so ask away. Google already knows about me and they are eeevillll, I‚Äôd rather share with you *tries to wink but gets eyelash in my eye*. However, if you‚Äôd rather not share something, you can just say ‚Äúpossum snout‚Äù and I will fully understand.\n\n*Pulls out another beach chair and palm leaf and starts fanning you back, but this quickly turns into a duel*\n\nToo late, the dream-walker üï∫ sees all!\n\n(P.S.

I don't want her roaming the hallways of retirement homes as the Grim Reaper, but I would like for her to trash grocery stores in skates with me sometimes. \nOh Mark Manson just writes about life and kind of put things into perspective, like how nonsensical societal standards and structures can be. How things mean so much and absolutely nothing at the same time. His writing is very humorous and very straightforward. I'll send you pictures of 1.5 pages if you want to read it.

It doesn't sound like \"stove on fire\" music, but it has the same effect that classical music has during a murder scene in movies.\n\nAh dang it! I should have moved my queen to B3 sooner, well GG. Time of death: 17:24.\n\nA show that I recently started watching, that's usually no one under the age of 40's taste, is Grey's Anatomy. Best of luck to you, and please don't blame me if you start asking people, \"Hand me the scalpel\" or replacing all your compliments with, \"You can scrub in,\" which is something the attendings ask only of the highest performing interns. \n\n\nI will indoctrinate you so much that you will soon be washing dishes in the bathroom sink and randomly doing push ups while talking to a stranger at the vet (plot twist: you own 0 animals). \n\nI can't say that I have. But not because I don't like them, possibly just for the same reason I haven't befriended a snail either. \n\n\"It is crazy to me how nobody has gone full Pixar villain by investing a lot of time, effort and money to gain the backing of all the crows in their general location..\" üòÇ\nGeneral Location ü´°\nI'm sorry but if I get lost in the wilderness with no means of reaching human civilization, I'm staying put.\nConsider it 'prayers answered'\n\"I really want to meet a raven,\" instantly made me think, \"I'm sure there's an app for that somewhere\"\n\n*intensely watches as the new asylumees get off the bus for a guy with a raven on his shoulder* \n\nYou make a valid point Mr. Holmes. And doesn't the concept of accepting cookies go against the whole, \"My mom taught me not to accept candy from strangers,\" thing? Suddenly it feels like an episode of Black Mirror and we are all ironically responsible for our own death.\n\nAn army of penguins against AI. Damn that should definitely be a show, or a movie, or some graffiti on walls. The moral of the story will be how your pain (discarded pebbles) can be turned into power (defeating AI which was supposed to take over the world), then Mark Manson can write about it on people's Starbucks cups. \n\nOmg I can just imagine the tribe arriving at a Japanese restaurant, ready to meet their god. Japanese kids are staring at the pages of their comic books and back at the tribe, waiting for them to \"kamehameha\". The tribe is taking the children's stares as a sign that they have been expecting them. The tribe starts performing their Adumu, expecting Enkai to show up any minute, and the children, having watched Dragon Ball Z before, flee from the restaurant in fear of an attack on Japan. \nJapan's Asahi Shimbun is cluttered with articles of a war starting between them and East Africa. \nMoral of the story: You don't wanna meet your heroes. \n\nThat's a very good question! I have no idea, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. \n\nYou really don't have to do that! You can mix coffee with dish soap and I'll probably still drink it. My feelings for coffee is beyond Nicholas Sparks' comprehension. I don't need the best coffee in the world. \n\nI understand completely. Let's not jinx it then. I, myself, am one to avoid stepping on cracks and walking under ladders. So I have the deepest form of comprehension for you superstition. \n\nHhmmmm, üïµ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èü™©üï∫üï∫ saga:\n*in fortune-teller voice, stroking my hands around a crystal ball* I am receiving energy from a room, it's dark, the room is empty, no, wait, there are two people in the room. In the centre of the room is a disco ball, rotating at 0.5x speed. A distorting mirror stands on the stage, for the randomness of it all. The one person is a woman. She has a magnifying glass, probably an entomologist, no, she's a detective. She stands under the disco ball. There's a guy.\n*male voice in the background appears. Crowd gets chills* \nThe guy is wearing....*curtain drops on the floor and reveals a guy speaking into a mic. I hastily reposition the curtain and gives the voice actor a stare that says 'your tip has been cut in half'. Clears throat and continues* The guy is wearing a white coat. He is a dentist. No, sorry, he is a doctor. The guy halts under the disco ball. They stare at each other, and they instantly know what the other is thinking. In a synchronized voice they utter the words, \"Victorian era-detective-who-has-a-god-complex-and-severely-unhealthy-anger-management-skills-themed disco party!\".\n\nI'm thinking that in the second book they can maybe kill Holmes and Moriarty for having childlike conflict resolution skills and end the night by eating ice-cream on the rooftop of the building in which they did the murdering. \n\nNow I have to watch it too because I've also never actually watched the movie. \n\nOohh really?! I found out about it recently actually. I watched Carrie for the first time a couple of years ago without even knowing that it was written by King. It's nice to know that I can read your mind *\"tries to wink but gets eyelash in my eye\"*\n\n\"Perfect is the enemy of good\" will be my new life philosophy, thank you for that. \nAh, I understand. So it's a quality over quantity situation?\n\nYou will hear no \"possum snout\" from me either, but thank you very much for saying that. I'm also not easy to make uncomfortable. I grew up with an older brother (which speaks for itself), and a rather strange taste in friends. \n\nI couldn't win a battle with a cricket, what makes you think I can win a fanning duel with you? *throws palm leaf on the floor and sinks into your beach chair*\n\nThe fire dance worked!!!! Well, it worked 95%, which is basically the new 100%. \n*reminds self that perfect is the enemy of good*\n\nOkay I have watched the first episode of season 2 and I actually laughed...out loud...more than 3 times. Especially where Michael talks about how he went out with a girl from HR and Dwight interrupts that they don't have a girl in HR and Michael says, \"for the sake of the story\" üòÇ and later he says before things escalated she made him fill out six hours worth of paperwork and Dwight asks, \"Like an AIDS test?\" üòÇ",

I used to play Alisa once upon a time, and by play I mean stand there while my health bar dropped to zero as I tried and failed to do anything cool with my chainsaw arm. Wanna beat me up?\n\n I will say though, I am rather decent at Street Fighter, where I‚Äôve developed my very own fighting style, which consists of 2 stances: Turtle School - Cowabunga Style: Path of the Snapping Tortoise, and the Way of the Wombat, Form VI: Drunken-fist advance of the gliding Quokka - no wait, where are you going?!\n\nYou also have a lot of medical professionals in your family/bloodline? We should get bingo cards. Ahh yes, fresh tears, the forbidden seasoning.  One time I half-watched Hachi on a flight and I had to fight back tears. Your penguin comment hits hard, you‚Äôre getting one of these -> ü•∫ \n\nAhhhh yessss, finally! I knew I couldn‚Äôt be 100% of the total addressable market for vanilla ice-cream.

I used crack, it‚Äôs very effective!\n\nMy nine children would be delighted to play with your six, that would be splendid! Maybe we can all get some ice-cream too.

I‚Äôve rehabilitated/saved so many little critters over the years: ants, a house gecko, a cricket, a spider,  a froggy, a dove, a kitten and even an iguana once! Mosquitoes manage to exhaust my patience after the 3rd warning though. This all sounds a little insane, until you consider that we spend a lot of resources looking for life on Mars, I just imagine the little critter is on the Martian surface instead of my immediate vicinity, and suddenly their value seems evident (fidgets with pockets like Newt Scamander). That said, my nine kids can totally Hadouken and Shoryuken little Nora. I could also help you demonstrate proper form when trashing grocery stores in skates, if you‚Äôd like.\n\nMark Manson sounds 100% just like me when I have one of my bi-yearly existential crises.  I must confess, the last part of my last message originally said something like ‚ÄúGoogle already knows everything about me, and I‚Äôm just a little speck of cosmic dust on a cool little rock in one of billions of galaxies amidst the infinite vastness of the Universe, so you really can ask me anything.‚Äù But I felt it wasn‚Äôt flirty enough *nods like Robert Redford in Jeremiah Jones*.\n\n*Listens to ‚ÄúThe Sims 3 loading screen bopping my head like the Vibing Cat meme* I see it now!\n\n*runs faster than Lightning McQueen, passes Sonic the Hedgehog, then The Flash, enters an unknown dimensional veil of juxtaposed timelines, sees you in the distance almost breaking the space-time continuum as you pull out your Tipp-Ex in the past/present/future, pulls out my own bottle of Tipp-Ex to erase the part where you said ‚ÄúTime of death: 17:24‚Äù.\n\nThat implies that you already do those things and you seem to be functioning well, so I accept your indoctrination process. \n\nWhy haven‚Äôt you befriended a snail? I can‚Äôt say that I have either, but Giant African Snails are almost kinda cute. Nevermind, I just watched a video of a group of them eating some kind of grain but it was sped-up and it was horrifying, do not look that up!\n\nAs compelling as that sounds, think about all the HIMYM marathons you‚Äôd be missing out on!\n\nHmmmmm, I looked up Raven but only found a hotel app, a bank, and  something to stream Netflix together with a party.

I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of a novella titled variations of ‚ÄúCAT KILLS A.I.‚Äù, I just keep seeing that image in my head.\n\nDid you know the first king of Hawaii was called King Kamehameha? \n\nI was watching the Adumu dance when I imagined the guy rocketing off into the stratosphere and it made me chuckle. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sharing this. I wonder if Japan actually does have a kind of earthbound Gundam stashed somewhere to defend itself and it‚Äôs not just a meme. I concur on not wanting to meet my heroes.\n\nI‚Äôm the same way! I may seem like I‚Äôm strolling around carefree, but in my head I‚Äôll be making believe (*I‚Äôm Making Believe by the Ink Spots and Ella Fitzgerald starts playing*) I must not step on the cracks, or else a landmine will go off. Just kidding. But do you also get a little sad when you're kicking a little stone on the sidewalk and then miss but you have to keep walking?\n\n‚ÄúSo I have the deepest form of comprehension for you superstition.‚Äú Anytime I hear the word ‚Äúsuperstition‚Äù, my mental jukebox plays Superstition by Stevie Wonder.\n\nThat whole paragraph sounds like something out of Dirk Gently, that‚Äôs really good!  ‚ÄúShe has a magnifying glass, probably an entomologist üòÇ‚Äù. \"Victorian era-detective-who-has-a-god-complex-and-severely-unhealthy-anger-management-skills-themed disco party!\" üòÇ \n\nOh no! *Conveniently produces a little bottle of eye drops and a handkerchief sealed in an antibacterial bag to rid your eye of said eyelash* \n\nYou are very welcome! Yes, that‚Äôs a good way to put it. Though you were also right about keeping them somewhere safe. I was listening to some old tracks earlier and I found some that I like more now that some time has passed.\n\nAhhh but remember Conan Doyle himself tried that and Sherlock just got Reichenbach‚Äôd (this is a me-original verb). That said, ice-cream on the rooftop sounds perfect.\n\n*Pulls out bingo card, scratches ‚Äúgrew up with an older brother‚Äù and ‚Äúrather strange taste in friends‚Äù*.\n\nWell, I wasn‚Äôt trained in the ways of the Mishima clan, for one - but I‚Äôll shut up now because this is much better.\n\nI watched the first episode of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy. Somehow it made me nostalgic, even though I‚Äôd never watched it before. It reminded me of that time I binge-watched the first few seasons of House, which also features a team of interns with suspiciously-great hair and crazy plot twists. Speaking of, the twists here were brutal! They really went for the feels. Are you still on S1? \n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it, don‚Äôt say it‚Ä¶‚Äù\nYou can scrub in now, STAT!\n\nI‚Äôm very glad to hear that you liked the episode! I went and watched it too *pretends like I‚Äôm hearing the jokes for the first time*.\n\nP.S:  I did a lot of research today and finally subscribed to a music distribution platform so I can show you more of my music!",

Now we can play, \"Guess the watery food!\"\n\nSo many plot twists! Dang it. Talk about rapid character development.\nI Googled Kuma and discovered he sailed the seas as a single-person pirate crew, he's a member of the near-extinct Buccaneer race and he's a father? It's almost the same as watching Hachi. \n\nYou are giving me a free \"Beat Me Up\" card??!! Oh my goodness, Christmas came early this year!

Thank you for letting me win! You can beat me up the next round :) \n\nI see Alisa is in Tekken 6, I have never played with her before. She has a chainsaw arm?! And you still lost?  *shakes head, tch, tch, tch, tch, tch* \n\nYou will definitely whip me in Street Fighter, I tend to just push random buttons and hope luck is on my side. \nI have to admit, I just can't take \"...Path of the Snapping Tortoise\" seriously though üòÇ\nYour whole paragraph 4 made me laugh out loud üòÇ especially the ending, \"-no wait, where are you going?!\" üòÇ\nAlberto, the comedic genius. I applaud you üëèüèª \n\nOh no, I have 0 medical professionals in my family, that I know of. But the usage of \"also\" makes me want to guess that you do? We should definitely get bingo cards. \nAn airplane is the absolute worst place to watch Hachi! I mean, the best place to get sympathy points, but that's a gamble. I bawled my eyes out at the ending, how did you manage to fight it? \n\nI know! They always play the \"boring\" card. There should be a refugee camp for people being emotionally affected by verbal terrorists stating that vanilla ice-cream is the b-word. \nYou've never played bingo before? That was almost something we could have crossed off the bingo card. I played it only once before.\n  \nCrack is the better alternative, it saves a lot of fish after all. \n\nOkay now I don't even want ice-cream if it's not sold by a pug. \"They just look like they know their gelato\" üòÇ\n\nThat made me so happy to hear *melting* \nYou saved a kitten? Was it a stray kitten? Okay so you saved a cricket before, but you bribed one to die during battle? Keeping things in equilibrium are we? \nOkay, okay, I can't use my inner voice anymore- you save ants??!! I save ants! People think I've completely gone bonkers when I tell them to look where they step. You saved a house gecko? Almost 3 weeks ago a spotted a baby house gecko in my place and Googled if I should put water out for it üòÖ I'm happy to report it's still alive and hydrated. \nAnd exactly the same with mosquitoes! I also warn them, actually talking to them like a madwoman, asking them to leave. \nI think we have gotten bingo now plenty of times. Time for a clean bingo card. \n\nIt doesn't sound insane to me at all. In fact, it's the most sane thing I've heard in a very long time. My argument is very similar. Why is it so easy for people to kill insects but not pets. If a ladybug was the same size as a dog then no one would have killed it (not that anyone kills ladybugs, but you get the point). Just because they are smaller doesn't mean they are insignificant. \nYes please! That would be very kind of you to teach us how to properly trash grocery stores in skates.\n\nTo be honest, I actually thought exactly the same thing- that Mark Manson sounds like you. I have never experienced you experiencing a midlife crisis though, but his writing personality is kind of the same. \nAnd also, I appreciate you swapping your original Mark Manson- aura, Tony Award worthy paragraph for a more flirty one. \n\nYou made it just in time, thank you! I needed that. \n\nNo, no, dear friend. Not me. The sims do that when left to their own devices. Strange little creatures they are. \n\nI am too busy trying to move them out of danger's way to befriend them. \n\" ...but Giant African Snails are almost kinda cute.\" üòÇ \n\n*moves hand towards keyboard and then pulling back, trying to decide whether I should look that up* \nFor the sake of me still regarding snails as cute enough to save, I shall follow your advise and not look that up. But I am fighting against a curious personality here. \n\nYou raise a fair point, once again. I shall memorise all the himym episodes and replay them in my head every night. \n\n\"LIES! *throws phone in swimming pool*\" üòÇ\n\nWhile you are out there in the wilderness, searching for a raven, do you mind just vaguely looking around every now and then for a tree that looks suitable to build a treehouse in?\n\n\"CAT KILLS A.I.\" made me think of the novel \"Meow\" by Sam Austen, where the word \"meow\" is just repeated for the entirety of the book. \nI read that as well! Very interesting. I wonder how a Hawaiin concept made it into a Japanese anime series though. \n\nPlease always share things that make you think, \"I don't know why I'm sharing this\" \nThank you for sharing that, it changed the way Autumn feels. Now I wonder that as well! I low-key want to send the characters from Scooby-Doo to go investigate it, but honestly, what makes me think I have that kind of power? \n\nThe black and white image of a guy looking back in agony as his little rock rolls off the sidewalk into the curb inlet with the song \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. playing, comes to mind. \nI can't say that it ever happened to me, but I deeply sympathize with your pain. It's always hard losing a friend that stuck with you for 9 steps. \n\n*Listening to Superstition by Stevie Wonder whilst replying to the rest*\n\nGoogled Dirk Gently, saw a Corgi, I'm happy. \n\n*Takes eyelash and places it in other eye for you to remove it again* \n\nOmg, I \"Tabitha'ed\" you! (only joking)\nI'm really glad you changed your perspective on some of them. I relistened to the songs you sent me about 4 times by the way. \n\nI like your newly invented verb.\n*send email to Oxford to add it to the dictionary*\nI tried Googling Reichenbach though, but sadly failed. I am, therefore, unable to provide any further commentary on your Reichenbach comment. For any further enquiries, please feel free to contact us or find us on Raven. \n\nAaahhh House! I was obsessed with that show when I was much younger. \n\"suspiciously- great hair\" üòÖ\nI am on season 2, ep24 already! \nAnd this morning I continued to watch The Office by the way. On episode 4. \n\nI can scrub in? Really!? Thank you, doctor, I have been waiting for this moment my whole life. I would like to thank my mom for letting me practise the art of scrubbing on dishes, my great-great- uncle who always looked one cough away from a cemetery, which motivated me to become a doctor, and last but certainly least.....üïî\n*patient dies*\n\nThat is GREAT, with whipped cream and a cherry on top! I'm super excited to hear more of them! Did I tell you that I went and relistened to the songs you sent me about 100 times?",

Kuma means bear, but to me that word makes it sound less cuddly, hmmm, bear with me here... Kuma... Bear... Bear just sounds snuggly. \n\n*Comes out of dressing room in inflatable Sumo suit* \n*Sees Tekken Character Select screen on the TV*\n*Waits for brain to load*  \nOh, you meant in the game!

Thank you, I always knew the problem was the audience. Fun facterino: A snapping turtle can bite your finger off in the blink of an eye, including the bone!  (Except if you‚Äôre wearing some protective plasters) rule #1 of the Art of War: ‚ÄúNever underestimate turtles, specially when they love pizza and ninjutsu\" . Anytime I type ‚ÄúüòÇ‚Äù it means I‚Äôve laughed out loud haha. \n\nSo I‚Äôve just googled Ninja Turtles Pizza and came across a cookbook somebody wrote after cooking all 67 pizzas pictured in the show apparently? One of them is ‚ÄúChoco-Chip & Gumdrops‚Äù and I think I need to try that at least once. There‚Äôs also Peanut Butter and Pickles, a combination so bizarre I had to do some research. It turns out there‚Äôs lots of recipes based around  PB & Pickles, from sandwiches to cookies. I also learned that Hemingway‚Äôs favourite sandwich was PB & Onion. *Looks at unfinished manuscript, then back at onion*‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthe hardest choices require the strongest wills‚Äù. \n\nAhhh the ol‚Äô switcheroo! I must‚Äôve misinterpreted the passage you referenced from ‚ÄúGirl, Get Off Your Phone and Learn Some Medicine, You Undereducated Insult to Your Bloodline, Volume 2‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt read that one. Have you ever watched the movie Airplane? That is both the best and worst movie to watch on a flight.  I think the ability to hold back tears could be mostly attributed to my being ultra-drowsy (at the time) from the Dramamine. I‚Äôve played La Loteria before, which is kind of like bingo, but with pictures!\n\nIt was a stray kitten indeed, he was just roaming around going ‚Äúooaawwwrgghh‚Äù and I thought I‚Äôd been selected by the cat distribution system, so I went and got him food and made him a little cot and after a little over a week one morning he just up and left and never returned. Cats gonna cat.\n\nNooo see that‚Äôs the best part, he just jumped off the ring onto a mini trampoline, after which he changed into a suit and tie and a little hat and disappeared into the crowd, we had the whole thing planned.\n\nA fellow ant-saviour?! A million times YES!!! Do you also know ant CPR? That‚Äôs how I save them when they get caught in the rain and one of the ants looks like it‚Äôs drowned but if you swipe it up carefully with the side of your fingertip and blow on it for about 20 seconds, a lot of the time they come back to life! Then you get to watch them dry their antlers with their little hands for about a minute.\n\nAww you put water out for the baby gecko, that‚Äôs adorable. The one I saved had been stuck on a piece of tape on the ground, can you believe that? After confirming eye movement I quickly googled it and followed a tutorial for how to unstick them. One must never remove them manually, instead, what I did was pour some soybean oil on a little container and I poured a little bit of oil on its body with a teaspoon and made sure it got all around its perimeter by gently poking around him with a Q-tip. After a few minutes of this he was free and ran away on his own, heheh. I give mosquitoes the speech too!! üòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm like ‚Äúlook I know you‚Äôre just trying to feed your kids, ma‚Äôam, but please chill!‚Äù\n\nI agree. I‚Äôve just found an officially-licensed Harry Potter bingo on Amazon (it‚Äôs all pictures so it‚Äôs really a Loteria set), I vote we use that next. \n\nYessss I know!!! It‚Äôs total malarkey. People who do that sort of thing are cretins, ruffians, miscreants, overall deplorable individuals *silence*‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthey‚Äôre right behind me, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù.\n\n*silent ultra-wide-angle shot of me running on the mountains with all the pitchfork-wielding-townsfolk right behind me*\n\n*Gets up on stage* ‚ÄúI want to thank Karla for this Tony Award, I ~literally~ couldn‚Äôt have done it without you‚Äù. \n\nMy existential crises aren‚Äôt too bad, I‚Äôll just be sad for a few hours a couple times a year, until I spot a dog and their human lets me pet them (the dog, not the human). I mean yeah last time I did end up $500k in debt in Vegas with the mob after my third fake alias, but really who hasn‚Äôt been there? \n\n‚ÄúNo, no, dear friend. Not me. The sims do that when left to their own devices. Strange little creatures they are.‚Äù\n*Camera zooms out to alien kid watching us both split-screen on his laptop, reading the dialogue in speech bubbles, the logo on the corner of the game says ‚ÄúThe Simulacra 3: Earth‚Äù.

According to some person on Quora: ‚ÄúSo when Akira Toriyama was trying to name his new ‚Äòkame‚Äô (which means ‚Äòturtle‚Äô) attack, he couldn‚Äôt think of anything. So his wife suggested that he used a reference to help him remember. She suggested the name of Late Hawilian King, ‚ÄòKamehameha‚Äô. Toriyama liked her idea enough to keep it. The name would be easier to remember for him if he just thought of the guy he named it after and why he named it that. Thus the ‚ÄòTurtle Destruction Wave‚Äô or Kamehameha was born.‚Äù\n\nI hear you. Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you. I was just thinking about professional taste testers and I wonder if they can enjoy food or if they‚Äôre always critical about it, maybe they even taste the air. Also, think of all the flavours that have been tested in a lab that nobody in modern history except for the taste-testers has ever tasted, like a Mango-Watermelon Croissant or a crunchy chocolate bar called Fake bubblegummy banana, Nutella doughnut and Cashews, Sprinkled with Caramelised Coconut. Just imagine! \n\nThat‚Äôs an excellent set-up for a short story. I wonder if one would get sued for writing a sci-fi comedy about a guy who‚Äôs always smoking the devil‚Äôs lettuce investigating his paranoid delusions with his previously-human dog companion who is addicted to the Zaza brownies the other guy bakes (he‚Äôs a drug dealer), but then it turns out his newest conspiracy theory was real! They infiltrate an air force facility but it‚Äôs completely deserted and nothing happens all day so they break into a hangar because it‚Äôs windy out and the guy has dry eye syndrome. So some more time passes, and when they finally give up and are getting ready to go home, they end up fighting over who gets the bigger half of the last brownie, when they bump into a side panel and one of the light fixtures transforms into a drone, which scans the guy like that scene with Gazerbeam in The Incredibles (alternatively, it could also be that the drone produces a keypad and prompts them for a password and the guy just inputs his birthday, which checks out, for reasons that will be revealed later) the hangar starts rumbling and a block of concrete flooring retracts, revealing stairs. They go down the stairs and find‚Ä¶ [to be continued]. Jesse, let‚Äôs cook.  See, you have the power!

Conan Doyle was ready to hang the cape so he sought out in that indescribable literary dimension a character who could bring about the end of Sherlock Holmes, and he found Moriarty. To avoid spoilers, let‚Äôs just say that something happens at the Reichenbach Falls which was to be the last time we see Sherlock Holmes. But of course, the people needed more Holmes, so Conan Doyle went back to his writing desk and we got more Holmes. \nIn other words:\nReinchenbach‚Äôd: adj -  When a literary character comes back to life due to immense popular pressure. \n\n*Squints eyes* Raven again, I knew it‚Ä¶\n\nYou too?! I stopped watching during S5, but I‚Äôve thought about watching it again a few times. I absolutely love the setup of Holmes and Watson working in a hospital.

I spent some time listening to the songs today to see which ones are the easiest to ‚Äúsing‚Äù, I think I‚Äôve narrowed it down enough. Now, acoustic pop or synth-pop? Oh, also, I need to pick an ‚Äúartist name‚Äù and I can‚Äôt seem to decide, most of my nominees are combinations of book characters üòÇ.\n\n I also like the name Rigel, it‚Äôs the name of a star that shines 50,000 times brighter than the Sun *megalomania intensifies*. It‚Äôs also the name of a cousin of mine whom I‚Äôve only met three times, but my first impression of him was him being scared to climb up to dive from the second(?) level of a diving platform until suddenly something changed in his eye and he started laughing and then he climbed all the way to the top, ran across the platform and jumped while shouting ‚ÄúGREGORIAAA!!!‚Äù at the top of his lungs. And that is such a funny scene to me. I don‚Äôt even know who Gregoria was, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sharing this (Ah-haaa! *snaps fingers, winks, does finger guns*).

The tree was dressed in ballet flats that were ready to exterminate...\"\n\n\"Wins next round by time-out\" ü•π\n\n \"..the problem is the audience\" is exactly what I said when I was sixteen and cooked steak that not even the dogs wanted to eat.\n I Googled turtles eating pizza and it feels like a crime against nature. Now I want to have a LOTR marathon and eat pizza with a turtle (while covering my whole body with Despicable Me plasters, of course)\nWho said dogs are the top animal companions? \nAlso, last night I dreamt about a tortoise, and I think your whole paragraph about the Path of the Snapping Turtle had something to do with it. \n\n\"Peanut Butter and Pickles\" sounds like the name of a Cartoon Network show. \nReading your text as a woman who doesn't even put two different foods on her fork. There's something about Hemingway eating Peanut Butter and Onions sandwiches that feels like it shouldn't be such a surprise. Like we all already knew it, but we weren't aware that we already knew. \n\nI definitely got into character of someone whose family are all doctors though, so no misinterpretation on your part. \nI haven't watched Airplane, but I have watched Snakes on a Plane. And Disney's \"Planes\". Also, Manifest (which is about an airplane that mysteriously crashed, Flight 828, and even more mysterious events happened after the crash. Would also definitely be one of my top favourite shows. Great acting by Parveen Kaur)\nThe cover of \"Airplane!\" looks great though, almost like a Salvador Dali painting, if it is the 1980's comedy/drama you are referring to with Leslie Nielsen.\n\nYou have to take Dramamine when flying? You get motion sickness? That's a coincidence, I don't get it when I fly, but whenever I use an elevator, I am severely off balance when I get out. I also easily get car sick. \n\nLa Loteria's pictures gives such an eclectic-retro vibe. Like something you should only be playing with a margarita in your hand. I've obviously never played it before, but now it will be added to my bucket list. Also, I saw the picture of the guy carrying the globe and I'm all about finding out what that means. \n\nThat \"ooaawwwrgghh\" painted the picture of baby dinosaur in my head. You even made him a little cot and he still abandoned you? That is so typical. Cats be making psychologists rich. No wonder so many people have abandonment issues. See, dogs would never do that. Dogs just invade your personal space and exhaust all your energy. They be driving you to a cardiologist with all the RedBull's you need to drink.\n\nOoohhhh so the cricket never had to die? That is great news! I kinda thought maybe that was the case, but then a small part of me still thought maybe he committed suicide when jumping off the ring. And then I remembered his family accepted 10 bushels of alfalfa, which made me think, \"Damn, 10 bushels of lucerne is enough to replace your son?\" then I viewed it from another perspective and thought maybe the cricket was a terrible son and just goes against every cricket morale. I have never psychoanalysed the morality of a cricket family so much in my life. But it has made me a stronger person today. \nAlso, the cricket wearing a suit and tie and hat probably changed the way the planets align. The image of that just makes every cricket jumping from a ring onto a mini trampoline and not wearing a suit and tie and little hat, feel sinister. \n\nThat is the cutest thing ever! I always blow on them when they get wet, but never knew that was, indeed, proper procedure! I guess saving ants just comes naturally to me *chuckles in a smug way but starts choking on a cough*\nThe mental image of them drying their little antlers made me wish they were dog-sized so that I can have an ant as a pet. But then I remembered what their mouths look like and I immediately lit 21 candles, sprayed the walls with a mixture of lavender- and peppermint essential oil and burned 3 strands of hair and a piece of paper with my name written in Greek, to keep the night terrors at bay. \n\nWow, you would do great in a white coat. You can definitely scrub in, doctor. \nAaahhh, soybean oil, of course! *takes notes* \nFrom now on I shall go nowhere without a small bottle of soybean oil and a few Q-tips. I wish there was a career where you'd have to just walk around, saving little animals who got hurt. Like being a good samaritan, but getting paid for it. Like a vet, on wheels. \n\"look I know you're just trying to feed your kids, ma'am, but please chill!\" üòÇ\n\nThat is so cool!! I found a Harry Potter Official Christmas Cookbook on Amazon! It has dishes like Neville Longbottom's Toad in a Hole and Bubble and Squeak. Nora would love that! You and your 9 kids want to join us for Christmas this year?

And decorate the Christmas tree with wizard wands, owls, and letters (the ones that came flying in through the fireplace in Philosopher's Stone). \n\nOh when you said, \"malarkey\" it made me think of Kate Mularkey in Firefly Lane which is played by Stella from himym, and Izzie from Grey's Anatomy as her best friend. \"I don't know why I'm sharing this.\"\n\n*Balistically screams, \"Witch, witch!\" and points to a nearby forest to redirect the pitchfork-wielding townfolks away from you* \n\n*Stands up to clap hands, looks around the room and gives everyone the \"I know that guy\" look*\n\nOh because I wanted to ask, \"If you pet their humans, can I visit you in prison?\"\n\n\"I mean yeah last time I did end up $500k in debt in Vegas with the mob after my third fake alias, but really who hasn't been there?\" üòÇ\n\nI always knew this was a simulation. I once almost got crushed on a motorcycle by a truck pushing me into a car on my right-hand side. When I fell off the bike, I very robotically, and lady-like, got up and stood with my hands clasped in front of me the same way cooks stood while waiting for royalty to finish eating their dinner, while waiting for the driver to stand up. Even I was amazed at my own sim-like movement. The driver was in shock and kept asking me if I got hurt, but I acted like it was just a normal Tuesday and that was just part of the routine, like brushing teeth in the morning. \nWith that being said, in my next science class, I will teach my students that our \"god\" is called LoremlpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdlipiscingElit, and that he has a mom and likes to eat dinner. \nAlso, I am extremely confused as to why LoremlpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdlipiscingElit hasn't used the \"motherlode\" cheat yet. \n\nVery true, I'm convinced even seeing butterflies drinking nectar from flowers in a zoomed-in, sped-up video would be terrifying. \n*lurks around the corner to see if all the night terror candles are still burning* \n\n\nNooo I haven't seen that üòÖ the kid was smart! Which movie would you want to memorise like that if you could choose? Probably one of the LOTR movies right? \n*gets stapler ready in case you say an episode of Parks and Recreation*\n\nMessage 3, paragraph 2: üòÇüòÇ\n\n\nI wonder how many copies the writer sold, wait let me Google. \nOh my gosh!! While I was searching for that, I came across information about the author of the book, Sam Austen: \n\"Sam Austen is a certified feline linguist,\" \nWHAT??!!üòÇüòÇ\n\"and former Professor of Feline Psychology at Golden State Medical University\" \nI guess they didn't make the amount of copies sold public. \n\nNo, I have absolutely not read it yet, but some say reading the first sentence is equal to reading the whole book. So, going with that logic- yes, yes I have. \nThat's a great idea actually! Or every now and then just replace one \"meow\" with another word and as a collective it will form one sentence that has some profound meaning, like, \"Switch to Royal Canin\" or something like that. \n\nOh wow, way to go Akira's wife! (Also, adding Tabitha'ed, along with Reichenbach'd, to our list of newly found verbs, still waiting on Oxford' reply, I think they are playing hard to get) \nI had no idea what a turtle had to do with anything so I had to Google again, and found out they went to Turtle School. Had to dig deeper as to what a turtle had to do with anything, found out the turtle represents Master Roshi's martial arts style. Now I'm overeducated in Dragon Ball Z and have no idea what to do with it.",

Imagine a restaurant serving only food/drinks that got rejected by taste testers. It would be like, \"Honeydukes meets Charlie's Chocolate Factory\" if run by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. \nWhy would anyone reject a Mango-Watermelon Croissant? ü•≤\nThe combination of food you mentioned made me want to write a cookbook with experimental recipes. It shall be for the brave of heart and mentally questionable individual, who does not fear the possibility of growing an extra toe or losing an earlobe. \n\nWhy do I feel embarrassed by the fact that I had to Google \"Zaza brownies\"? \n\"..a guy who's always smoking the devil's lettuce investigating his paranoid delusions with his previously-human dog companion who is addicted to Zaza brownies the other guy bakes (he's a drug dealer), but then it turns out his newest conspiracy theory was real!\" üòÇ\n\"...and the guy has dry eye syndrome.\" üòÇüòÇ\nOh my gosh, that is such an accurate (and mildly childhood-ruining) description of the show. By the way, the whole concept of how they constantly unmask the villains/monsters and usually it turned out to be their friends or people they trusted is such a disturbing, albeit accurate, detail about life. That show is actually loaded with so many tiny, disturbing details that I fortunately never even realized as a kid. \nIs the, \"Jesse, let's cook\", a reference to Breaking Bad? Also, that's another show that people absolutely adore and I only watched 1 episode. \n\n\"a seed with unfathomable potential waiting to sprout\"\nThat is one description of a Corgi I have never heard before. In fact, I don't think I have heard that about anything, not even a seed itself, before. \nAnd the heart on its bum is probably the best part about it! And the tiny short legs! \n\nAahhh okay, it's the same thing that happened to someone in Prison Break. I never really watched Sherlock Holmes to be honest, so there was absolutely no way I would have guessed the Reichenbach situation. I have only watched Enola Holmes (who's Sherlock Holmes' sister, apparently). She was written to be even smarter than Sherlock, supposedly for the whole feminist thing, and then for some reason it was important to note that her name spelled backwards is \"alone\". It was a great cast actually to be honest, we had Bellatrix, Eleven, Clark Kent, Finnick Odair, Professor Remus Lupin and Petunia Dursley all in one movie. \n\nOh..my...gosh...!!!\nNow that you mention it, it makes so much sense! \n*insert glass shattering sound effect similar to the himym episode when everyone's illusions are shattered*\nWhy did I never realize? Probably because I never watched Sherlock Holmes before and I was quite young when I watched House, but still, I should have known! No excuses! I'm going blindly through life, BLINDLY I say! \n*Starts meditating, drinks 7 multivitamin pills, reads 5 educational books, goes for a jog to Kenya and back*\nOkay, I think I'm ready to do life again. \n\n\nStitches? You need stitches? I know a doctor who can.....\n*sprints to another room, reappears as Anxiety from Inside Out, holding a needle and thread in hands, blinks twice* \n...give you stitches. \n\nI'm now almost finished with episode 7, but they are much shorter than Grey's Anatomy. You really don't have to watch GA again üòÖ, obviously only if you want to. \n\n*The chicken from Corn Flakes appears in the frame, sees Tony the Tiger, hands him the drugs he ordered from the Toucan. I look at them, confused, then proceed to eat my Froot Loops* \n\nNo, siree! No Lightning McQueen crocs here in my vicinity. I made a mistake sorry, it won't happen again. I obviously meant I listened to them 178 times. \n\nYou sing synth-pop? That is so different from the songs you sent me before, I'm very excited to hear you singing different genres!\n*hands you a pharmacy receipt for soybean oil, a palm leaf and a bingo card to sign your autograph*\n\nThat is such a tough decision, I can't Tabitha you on that. That is all you. \n\"*megalomania intensifies*\" üòÇ\nIf you really wanted to go for the megalomania effect, then I could have given you a name, 12 years ago because I can't remember it anymore. \nMore or less 12 years ago someone came to our school and gave a science speech and showed us pictures of something in the universe that basically holds everything in existence together, which is exactly the same shape as something found in the human body that holds everything in our body together. But I can't remember what it was. \n\nRigel sounds awesome! And feet are very important! And it's personal because you have a cousin who jumped from a cliff for someone named Gregoria, which could be considered either romantic, vengeful, suicidal or the aftermath of Zaza brownies, and the lack of knowledge about which one of those options it is, makes it poetic and mysterious. \nSo, we have: poetic, mysterious, gets you from point A to B, shines brighter than the sun. And these qualities combined is really more than anyone can ask from an artist. \nI'll give you a Grammy Award for the name, but this time, can you give me an autograph in front of the crowd as you go up to give your acceptance speech, please? Also, if you can add, \"I gave this person plasters,\" I would really appreciate it.",

Elevators too! Ughh I hate that feeling like sudden warm light-headedness, I usually take the stairs unless it‚Äôs the 99th floor. Btw, have you seen those goofy-looking motion sickness glasses that Citr√∂en developed? \n\nI have failed the game of La Loteria, I‚Äôve never had a margarita before, it sounds purple though, is it purple? Hmmm. I too would like to know why the card for ‚ÄúThe World‚Äù features Mexican Atlas. I‚Äôm afraid the game will not give you answers on that front, only more questions, which might be slightly more interesting. \n\nWhat‚Äôs your favourite dinosaur? \n\n‚ÄúCats be making psychologists rich‚Äù üòÇ. \n\nI know!

I love that, I just looked up the cookbook. I like that it says ‚ÄúEASY-TO-FOLLOW-INSTRUCTIONS‚Äù, hopefully we won‚Äôt set the stove on fire. It‚Äôs funny that you mention that actually because Gandalf, Obi-Wan, Harrypotter and the rest of the kids were just asking if we could join you and your kids for Christmas! Ok in reality I was telling them to convince Nora so she would convince you. \n\nI haven‚Äôt seen Firefly Lane but it sounds like there could be a story there! It really fits the music I‚Äôm listening to right now, Dye by Tycho. I think it‚Äôs because it kind of sounds like some of the music in Life is Strange, my favourite videogame (along with Nier:Automata). \n\n[to be continued]",

That means 50k simoleons is a little over $18k. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sharing this.\n\nI just watched a video of a bumblebee dislodging pollen in slow-mo, I couldn‚Äôt find any in fast-mo, or even mo. \n\nWhich movie would I want to memorise like that? Hmmmm that‚Äôs a great question. My favourite movies are Whiplash and Ready Player One, the latter is very different from the book but I absolutely love it, there‚Äôs puzzles and it helps that the protagonist is very good at picking up on hints *flashback voiceover: ‚ÄúI never really know how far to go when someone asks for a hint‚Äù* *flash-foward to present* I mean - yes LOTR of course, how‚Äôd you know? *silence, bombastic-side-eye* actually I might bundle up all of Parks and Rec into one movie just to ann- *gets hit by stapler* \n\nWhat movie would you pick?\n\nOk I was not expecting cashew apples to look like that.

Even if we assume he got 30 friends and family to give it fake ratings, that‚Äôs still a lot more than I expected. \n\n*searches Amazon*\nOk someone‚Äôs shared a picture of their cat reading the book in their review. It says ‚ÄúHe purred loudly while reading it‚Äù. Austen might be onto something here.\nPeople will buy anything.\nThen again, I did once buy an audiobook titled ‚ÄúGo the [redacted] to Sleep‚Äù, it‚Äôs one minute long and narrated by‚Ä¶ you guessed it, Sam L. Jackson, so I can‚Äôt really blame them. The audiobook was ‚Äúonly a dollar‚Äù and has provided many a chuckle on nights I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep (I‚Äôve listened to it maybe 3 times), worth it. \n\nYes, and also they should spray the book with Royal Canin fragrance.\n\nThat sounds scrumdiddlyumptious. Oh and don‚Äôt forget to add Applausing, as well! \nIf they don‚Äôt reply soon I‚Äôm gonna start sending them dictionary pages in the mail. \n\nSee I knew a turtle-based martial arts style was a good idea, Master Roshi trained Goku and Goku is like Superman, that means I‚Äôm invincible.\n\"Now I'm overeducated in Dragon Ball Z and have no idea what to do with it\".

Now I feel the need to mention I‚Äôve never actually done any kind of recreational drugs, they just have high comedic value on the page. \n\n‚ÄúOh my gosh, that is such an accurate (and mildly childhood-ruining) description of the show.‚Äù\nNo no, see, the story was totally not inspired by Scooby-Doo at all! In fact, it was based on a true story! Yes yes, it was on the newspaper, right after a story I read about trees fighting cats and ninja stars. *‚ú®Childhood restored*\n\nThe amount of adult details in cartoons that one simply misses as a kid is astounding. \n\nI can understand not liking a popular franchise. When the Game of Thrones show was coming to an end and everybody was losing their minds, I tried watching it and couldn‚Äôt make it past the first 5 minutes of the first episode. My favourite show is Sherlock *bombastic-I-already-read-your-message-three-times-smirk*.\n\nI haven‚Äôt seen Enola Holmes, but I resent the fact that they passed up a Mycroft movie, the guy‚Äôs been waiting since the Victorian era.

My meditation is simply closing my eyes and breathing deeply for about 25 minutes every day. The haters might even call it a power nap.\n\nOne of the stories I‚Äôve been writing is about a guy with a talking dog on an intergalactic quest for a stolen baseball card, or at least that‚Äôs the initial hook. I think. I wonder if we could get Samuel L Jackson to voice the dog. Omg I think I've just had an idea for another story I‚Äôm writing, its project title is ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Bling‚Äù. It has nothing to do with LOTR, it‚Äôs about a precious stone that‚Äôs more than meets the eye. Precious stone‚Ä¶ jewellery... oh wait, not again! *Sigh* Anyway, there‚Äôs secret organisations and stuff, and I‚Äôve just thought it could be distantly related to the one in space that‚Äôs set in the future!

That was my favourite plot line, the model/doctor going vigilante. Also the lines ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not the enemy, you‚Äôre just the competition‚Äù and ‚Äúyou can waste your life drawing lines or you can live your life crossing them‚Äù *hangs inspirational poster*.\n\nWhy did I picture that whole scene so vividly? üòÇ \n\nAre you saying all the Froot Loops of the world have been compromised?! \n\nOnly 178 times? Ahhh ok, I thought that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd heard anyway.\nNow I‚Äôm contemplating throwing you a total curve ball with an unexpected genre. \n\n*steals your pharmacy receipt for the tax refund*\n\nCould you mean gluons? The graphical representations sort of resemble a cell (though that seems to be in the context of a pion, from what I gather) and it also is a fundamental binding force thingy. Also you get graphics of a ‚Äúquark‚Äù with the same search, at that point you‚Äôre basically splitting hairs. Some of the pictures of quarks look pretty cool. Fun facterino: On the Wikipedia entry for the Higgs field it says: ‚Äúunlike any other known quantum field, it has a Sombrero potential‚Äù and I think that‚Äôs pretty neat.\n\nFeet are indeed very important! *Tarantino intensifies*.\nI would hope there were no Zaza brownies involved, seeing as how we were around ten years old. \nRigel it is! Now I just need a last name, or a second name. I‚Äôve tried a dozen and they‚Äôre all taken. \n\nOmg thank you so much for the Grammy!\n\n*Bribes the cameraman to super zoom in on your face during my acceptance speech while the person behind you cuts an inordinate amount of onions*",

Hears a sound at the door, fast forward 20 minutes and the apartment now has an elephant, a crocodile, a kuma, hedgehogs, rattlesnakes and possums all watching LOTR and eating pizza* \n\nI didn't write down the dream because the tortoise didn't have a happy ending üòî\nOkay, technically, lasagne counts as one food.

(If I already asked this and just can't remember you answer, I am terribly sorry)\n\nI have never thought about dinosaurs to the extent of having a favourite one, but this question made me happier than it should have. \nPachycephalosaurus!! They are SO DARN CUTE! Have you seen the babies???

Thinking about it, wasn't it Zeus himself who cough-choked just like you before striking down Typhon with his lightning bolts? So if anything, that was a power move. \n\nYes yes! The, \"Easy to follow instructions\" where the best part for me too! Even if we do set the stove on fire, between the two of us there are 15 kids to figure out how to un-fire it. \nOohhh I see, well, since we're being honest, I asked Nora to play the \"I was adopted\" card and give you a whole speech about how important it is to her having lots of people around during the festive season. But since you already agreed, I can tell her to abort mission and call my houngan to make her forget that she was adopted, and go straight to Home Depot to get myself a \"Mother of the Year\" trophy. \n\nLife is Strange sounds intriguing! After I listened to \"Dye\" by Tycho, \"Calico\" by Haux started playing as I researched the game. And as I read that it's about a girl returning to her hometown to finish high school, combined with the song playing, it gave me major Twilight vibes! \nI know 98% of the population hates Twilight, so just use a hole punch instead of a stapler this time please.

Gives self a pat on back for figuring it out. Googles \"careers for extremely intelligent women, specifically specialising in 'mo'\", opens new tab and Googles, \"How to deal with own ego after deciphering complex linguistic problem (for beginners)\" \nGoogle responds, \"Did you mean: 'Spill the tea on how to chill with your ego after nailing a toughy, for the total freshies'?\" \n\nOoohhh I see Whiplash has a great cast! Never watched it before though, but already planning on. I recall Ready Player One from a previous conversation we had, and I'm almost convinced I watched it before but I might be wrong. \n\"actually I might bundle up all of Parks and Rec into one movie just to ann- *gets hit by stapler* üòÇ\n\nHmmmm, I think I wouldn't choose my favourite movie, just to not wear it out. I think I would choose an Owen Wilson movie just for the sake of his iconic voice, it doesn't really matter to me which one. \n\nOh well, my second guess after cashew nuts would have been sand. Gum-Gum fruit would have been right after that.\nI couldn't resist the urge to look up cashew apples and I had to double-check that I'm still on the correct planet. The amount of air pollution was my first, and only, indicator. \n\n\"Even if we assume he got 30 friends...\" üòÖ \n\n\n\"...I'll read you one last book if you swear you'll go the f to sleep\" üòÇ\n\"I know you're not thirsty, that's bullsh%& stop lying, lie the f down my darling, and sleep\" üòÇüòÇ\n\"....it's been 38 minutes already, Je$%¬£ Chr&@>, wtf?!

That was the greatest bedtime story anyone has ever written üòÇ \n\nYou have my full support on that idea. In fact, researching on how to make catnip-paper as we speak. \n\nThey replied, and you don't want to hear this, but they called us a bunch of 6-letter words.

Curls into a bundle and cradles body on floor, sobbing, \"They were right! I am a \"dunder\" and a \"dimwit\"!\" \n\n\"Godspeed, Karla.\" üòÇ\n\nI have never trained in martial arts, but remeber I told you I grew up with an older brother? Yeah, I have a white belt in verbal violence, came in more handy than martial arts for me. \nYou can do Taekwondo?! *Unlocks all doors, opens all the windows and places all valuable possessions on windowsills. Robbers enter. \"Oh no! I'm being robbed!\" Places back of hand on forehead for dramatic effect, \"I wonder who will come save me!\"*\n\nThanks for the advice, I will never do that. \n*checks road to the nearest Subway, and cuts hole in side of shoe for soon-to-be extra toe to hang loose*\n\n*pulls face into a grimace* that sounds...*runs to bathroom to barf* great! Yeah, no, that...that sounds really yummy. *wipes mouth with back of hand*\n\nI'm not super experimental when it comes to food though, so the weirdest thing I can think of is probably eating dog food as a kid, but who hasn't? \nApparently people think mayo in pasta is weird, which to me is super normal? \n\nThe use of the \"‚ú®Ô∏è\" made me think of \"@ramalauw\" videos. \n\n\"The haters might even call it a power nap\" üòÇ\n\nSamuel L Jackson voicing a dog, dang that's a great idea. Oohh they should get Samuel L Jackson to read the Meow book too! \n\nI am not saying that, but I am also not not saying that. So the real question is- wtf? \n\n*puts on baseball glove, waiting in anticipation for your curve ball genre* \n\n*steals your pharmacy receipt for the tax refund* üòÇ\n\nAfter looking at everything, even doing research about sombreros, I still don't think it's any of those. I have gone through all 5 stages of grief to finally accept the fact that I will never know what it was, and that maybe life, in all it's chaotic bliss, will forever remain a mystery to the forgetful mind. \n\nWhich last names did you like that was already taken?",

I know, right? And what‚Äôs with all those stories out grandparents told of mysterious happenings everywhere? Did all the supernatural creatures get internet access one day and decide it wasn‚Äôt worth going out to scare people at night?

In fact, just today he got out *checks news* 34 emissions (behave yourself, Greggy!). This is not ideal, but most of the time he‚Äôs pretty chill *pats volcano* apparently he must‚Äôve been doing this for thousands of years because I just looked up the name and it means ‚Äúmountain that smokes‚Äù, somebody flew a drone over it and as you get close you can hear Snoop Dogg records play 24/7.  \n\n*looks up Bobble* Hmmm are you sure?

Good parenting.\n\nNora is adopted too?! Frankly, I haven‚Äôt told mine, but I think they remember me luring all those storks with Alaskan crack, we just don‚Äôt really talk about it. I read up on the houngan and now every time I play Mambo No. 5 it‚Äôll be with the knowledge that it‚Äôs actually Haitian Voodoo Priestess No. 5. It also says the practice originated from a place called the Kingdom of Dahomey (I‚Äôm reading that as ‚Äúda homie‚Äù). I told Gandalf to reverse-pickpocket Nora‚Äôs backpack today (after class let out) and drop a little bag of olives in there for you, did you get it? \n\nI listened to ‚ÄùCalico‚Äù by Haux and that fits in with the game as well! (You win this time, algorithm). I haven‚Äôt read Twilight *dodges stapler nonchalantly, already used to it*  but I watched the first movie! I remember the scene where they play baseball, that was cool. \n\nI would totally watch that show, even if it only got 50% on Rotten Tomatoes and was called ‚ÄúPrison Escape‚Äù.\nI watched a video once of a Japanese man who escaped from prison four times! I think you could give him a run for his money.\n\nThat was just my way of asking if you had somehow been a member of an outlaw biker gang before changing your ways and becoming a teacher, and if you had been riding the bike as a passenger of some ruffian that I might have to fight in the finale of S1, but then it turns out he was an informant, and his wallet falls out when he‚Äôs running away from my nunchaku-boomerang, then the other bikers find the wallet when they get to the place (he had called for backup, the coward), but by then I‚Äôve fled the scene, and immediately after, the cops get there and a fight breaks out. But then an old lady gives a witness account that she saw me there (I‚Äôm famous and hiding in the bushes) and both the cops and the bikers shoots at the bush, and the season ends in me diving into the water (S2 opens with my bullet wound being patched up with Despicable Me plasters). \n\nI didn‚Äôt know you could get that type of Uber, but I know East Asia loves motorbikes. I heard there‚Äôs only about twice as many people as there are scooters in Taiwan. \n\n\"But, in general I really enjoy watching science/philosophy documentaries, especially by Carl Sagan, Alan Watts and Neil deGrasse Tyson, or basically anyone.\"\n*Sits down slowly*\n*gulps, drinks entire glass of water* *picks up palm leaf to fan himself*\nThat‚Äôs me! I have Carl Sagan, Alan Watts and Neil deGrasse Tyson‚Äôs books (ok, only one or two of each, but still). My favourite physics-explainer is Feynman *tangential shoutout to the book Thing Explainer even though I‚Äôve never read it. The book looks embarrassed as it continues to eat its dinner. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that guy‚Äù it says to its book friends*, though that doesn‚Äôt mean I approve of Feynman‚Äôs views as a person, especially his late-night lifestyle (coughcoughI‚ÄôveNeverBeenUnfaithfulAHEMMAAHHHCoughImJustSayingAGGGAGHHCOUGHH) *drinks water* sorry. \n\nTo be fair, mammals are an extremely interesting topic. I mean, I just googled ‚Äúmammals‚Äù and there‚Äôs a picture of a kangaroo (cool pouch!), and a polar bear (huh, why no pouch?), and a Tyger Tyger (where does he keep all the Frosted Flakes?).\n\nI‚Äôve always loved to know how things work. Like, always. Think: *sees fire for the first time after gaining self-awareness at age three* \n‚Äúwhat is that?‚Äù \n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fire, you already know fire‚Äù\n‚ÄúYeah but what is it?‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fire, don't try to touch it‚Äù\n‚ÄúNo no, where does it come from?‚Äù \n‚ÄúAsk your father‚Äù\n‚ÄúFather, where does fire come from?‚Äù\n‚ÄúAnywhere with oxygen and a fuel source‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a phew sauce?‚Äù\n‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúThis is called an encyclopaedia, son. Have fun‚Äù.\n\nI remember having a visual encyclopaedia that I really loved when I was probably four or five, it had a lot of cool pictures about astronauts ~~cosmonauts~~, satellites, planets, etc. and my favourite video game at the time (probably) was a quiz game about human anatomy that covered many different sections. \n\nDuring lockdown I was bored constantly so I took Coursera and edX courses on topics like Genomics and Chemistry for no reason. I was really enjoying How The Earth Works (audiobook) last year until I dropped it about 70% of the way (I think I was probably addicted to some novel at the time). \n\nIn general ü´°, I would say I enjoy casual pop-sci. There‚Äôs a lot of books that I enjoy that are kind of nerdy that aren‚Äôt really science-y though, like the book I was reading on the history of double-entry accounting, or the one about the history of the shipping container, or the one about caffeine, or the one about why we sleep, or the one about the financial history of the world, or the one about‚Ä¶ hmmm, I really need to read The Forest Unseen and Bryson‚Äôs books.\n\nIn which science topics are you interested? \n\nThat explains a lot about the Sims economy. Maybe they don‚Äôt stress about money so much because they can just use the ‚Äúmotherload‚Äù cheat at any moment? Do you remember what careers you usually picked for your Sims? Were they all criminals? What kind of crimes did they get up to? Are we talking petty theft or embezzlement?\n\nI for one commend you on that. \n*Hangs medal around your neck*\n\n\"Did you mean: 'Spill the tea on how to chill with your ego after nailing a toughy, for the total freshies'?\" üòÇ \n\nYa like jazz? üêù\n\nHmmmm *as Owen Wilson: ‚Äúwow‚Äù.\nThat‚Äôs a very good point.

Ultimate relaxation. *Floats cross-legged*\n\nOmg they should totally get him to do the Meow book, I might actually read it then, although on 2x speed.\n\nI have narrowed down my curveball picks enough that I can flip a coin to decide tomorrow. I should have something up and be on the path to world domination in time for my next message. The list of names I‚Äôve tried but were already taken is too long to fit on the internet, but here‚Äôs some that are available, none of which match my face:\n\nRigel Caufield (after Max Caufield from Life is Strange, but it sounds more fitting for a professional golfer), I cannot help but notice that your fake name sounds similar, ‚ÄúMichaela Scofield‚Äù, have you been copying my notes?  \n\nRigel Adams (for Douglas Adams)\n\nAdam Rigel (after my uncle Adam, who is certified cool, but it sounds like a serious name, thought that might be my imagination.

It didn't matter if you were fatally sick, in a wheelchair, or extremely despressed because your favourite boyband broke up- you walked! According to medical reasoning, we were suppose to get hip replacements by age 11, but see, there was a line and grandma Suzy was first in it. After her, aunt Shelley would get one and then probably the dog. By the time it was your turn, your orthopedic surgeon already passed away and due to trust issues that stemmed from the barter economy, you refused to get any surgeries by a doctor who hasn't performed on at least 12 of your family members, so we grew up limping our way through life. Once I was walking to school, and this limping Bigfoot chased after....\"\nAaaahhhh! *realizes where all the monster/ghost stories came from*\n \nHow dare that ghost tell you that your writing is \"ignorant\" ? Did the ghost hear the story of how you were given an encyclopedia when you were 3-years old? Did it open your search history to see all the research you do (mostly sped-up and slowed-down versions of insects eating food, but that's not the point)? That ghost's opinion about your writing being \"ignorant\" is in itself very ignorant. \n\n\"Jose Marcos said that when he was a child, Don Goyo -- full name Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl -- came to his house for a glass of water and a taco.\"\n\n\"We asked him 'who are you?' He said: 'Don't you know me? I'm Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl. I'm the volcano,' the 77-year-old farmer said.\"\n\nHay, let's play a game of Never Have I Ever! Okay, I'll go first- never have I ever been more confused about the identity of a volcano in a France24 article.\" \nOkay game is finished. \n\nGoogles the side effects of inhaling volcanic ash, sees words and terms like, \"....not a pleasant way to die.\"\n\"Eventually, lung failure and death.\"\n\"Ask the people of Pompeii. They all died.\"\n\"....dust pneumonia...\"\n\"...it can act like a cement powder. You breath in the ash, and trap most of the ash in your nasal system, and inside your lungs. Nasal system and lungs have moisture, so ash will start to react and hardened just like cement. Imagine having a small sand in your lung, you will start to cough. When you cough, the dust will move because of the breathing and coughing, it will create a friction against in your lung, and it might bleed.\"\n\n*chuckles nervously* hehe, not that I care ppppfffftttt, but how serious is it though? \n*Tries to avert the panic in her voice with mild humour* is that where your eleventh toe came from? \n\n\"...somebody flew a drone over it and as you get close you can hear Snoop Dogg records play 24/7.\" üòÇ\n\nYou telling me that I can pull off the Bobble look simultaneously flatters and confuses me. It's not the type of compliment that makes you feel good, but rather the type of compliment that you very well know no one else in the world has ever received before. \n\n*strokes hand over trench coat* gosh I love the fabric of this coat! And the stitching must have been done by *steals Barney's line from himym*  \"a bunch of nuns in a convent.\"\n*3 hours later, now standing with a magnifying glass inspecting the texture on the coat* \nYou: \"Hey, are you gonna join the 'mothaflippin' dark side or not\" \n(By the way, I love the pivotal role a magnifying glass plays for us).\n\nThat is extremely thoughtful of you! Thank you! I still have some unfinished business with my current kidney though, but once that's sorted, I shall immediately inform you. \n\nI watched that episode and suddenly remembered why Sheldon and I were in a love-hate relationship. \n\"I remeber the song! It's called 'Darlin'' by The Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness, I'm not crazy! I don't have to take a pigeon as my bride.\" üòÇ\n\nHold up, you wrote a song called Bubble Up? There are so many questions. Is this a metaphorical bubble? Does the bubble represent X encapsulated in Y due to Z? Is there a G minor in there somewhere? Is the bubble an inanimate object or does the bubble have an interesting split personality that is both grotesque and charming? Does the bubble have anything to do with Bubble Boy? Does the phrase \"Bubble Up\" imply to protect yourself against something/someone? \n\n\"I only drink moonshine.\" üòÇ\nThe word \"moonshine\" made me think of \"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,\" but here it refers to a glowing substance, obviously. Owls don't drink moonshine as far as my knowledge tells me. \n\n\"My favourite beverage is a nice cup of room-temperature water *throws in face* ahhhh, delicious.\" üòÇ\n\nYou have introduced me to a whole new brand of beverages and I am forever grateful. Hibiscus tea with sugar and tamarind water sounds like a drink you'll be handed at the gates of heaven. So you are basically just prepping your taste buds. \n\nOkay, that's not fair because I didn't know that you had dinosaur ancestors otherwise I would have chosen that one too! They look super awesome! Some of them are vibrant green and others have colourful stripes on their faces. They look like they should have been able to play catch with the asteroid that caused their extinction, though. \n\n(Prepare yourself for blast-off to planet \"Message 2\" which we will be reaching within the next 0.000000511 light years).",

I would sleep with a Neil deGrasse Tyson book in my arms just to smell the pages. \nHave you seen that video...wait, wait, I'll send the link, hopefully it opens correctly.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/Bkxdxo3u1OI?si=0_C4PF5kdOpPUghO\n\n\"The book looks embarrassed as it continues to eat its dinner.\" üòÇ\nThe cover of Thing Explainer is actually quite brilliant. \n*Adds to your Simology that you have never been unfaithful, game algorithm automatically changes and the female Sim that was about to knock on your door involuntarily turns around, does 78 push-ups, sets a public garden on fire, and walks to a restaurant to adopt a cat. Insert me smiling like Marshall Eriksen in HIMYM S3E1 at 15:28*\n\nPolar bear with pouch is my favourite polar bear. Speaking of kangaroos, I recently saw a video of a guy in Australia wearing a kangaroo costume and a baby kangaroo in his yard jumped into his pouch üòÇ\n\n\"What's a phew sauce?\" üòÇü•π SO CUTE!\nThis whole dialogue between 3-year old Alberto and his dad reminded me of that scene in The Croods where they discovered fire for the first time. Also, a round of applause, a medal, a trophy, a statue and a part of the ocean renamed after your dad for giving you an encyclopaedia. \nAlso, I just discovered that, according to Google, the preference for \"encyclopedia\" to \"encyclopaedia\" is 99 to 1. Turns out you are that 1. \nOh my gosh, I can ever so vividly imagine little Alberto, going through his \"encyclopaedia\" with a magnifying glass trying to figure out what a \"phew sauce\" is. \nCan I completely freak you out? I take that as a yes. When I was little, also around 4 or 5 (I kid you not) we had a gigantic hard cover human anatomy book (I think my dad still has it today), and second to searching for fairies and elves in the garden, that book was probably my favourite thing. I tried searching for the book and found the exact one on Amazon, apparently it's by Giovanni Iazzetti.\nAahhh the nostalgia of being young and seeing a human tendon for the first time. \n\n(The reply on the rest will definitely come tomorrow, so sorry!)",

    "text": "Hearing you say how you read science books when you were bored is like listening to \"Arrival of the Birds\" by Cinematic Orchestra. \nDuring the school holidays earlier this year, I was also bored and immediately regretted not bringing my old finance books with me. I think that is the peak of boredom: the urge to read economics.\n\n*In general ü´°*\n\nWaaaaiiiitttt üòÇüòÇ you read a book on the history of double-entry accounting?! \n*unrolls an ancient scroll and starts reading the side-effects:\n\"Apotemnophilia, Cotard's Delusion, Capgras Syndrome, Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, Prosopagnosia, Pica, Hoarding disorder and mild dehydration\"\nThe Forest Unseen sounds very interesting gosh! Already added it to my reading list! \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" by Bill Bryson sounds like it was written specifically for you. \n\nOh honestly just everything! Information is like a 20-layered Ferrero Rocher ice-cream cake to me. I could probably watch a 3-hour documentary on the manufacturing of chairs (okay that's stretching it a bit maybe).\nI saw a book called \"The Theory of Everything Else: A Voyage Into the World of the Weird\" and I think life is a better place with it. \n\nI never let them have careers, I just use the \"motherlode\" cheat üòÖ but I did let them write books and self-publish it though. \nI took morality a little bit too serious for someone playing a game, and never let them be criminals. The most spontaneous I've been was to let my Sim go to university (I can't remember what she studied but even though I made her study 24/7, she still failed. I don't know if she was inherently dumb, but I did my part. What's that saying- you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink? I think my water was whiskey, and boy oh boy did my horse drink) \n\nI can identify as someone who likes jazz, why? Did you compose a jazz song? *starts wagging tail*\n\nPermission to change answer to Al Pacino granted *transforms into judge Judy and hits gavel on block* \n\n\"I will not stand this! *takes a seat*\" üòÇüòÇ\nAlso, starting own publishing house may or may not have been a childhood dream of mine. Everyday is just another day that I have to remind myself I am not Margaret Tate. \n\nI love how robbers have evolved to be more patient. I almost feel sorry for the robber for getting tased. Plot twist, he actually came to return an item he stole 2 weeks ago. The hard work and dedication of a very intelligent A.I psychologist he said. Or was it A.I companion? I'm not sure, but it doesn't matter. All that matters is that I got my fire extinguisher back. \n\nI can confirm that dogs have good reason for drooling while eating. And I won't report to Mother Nature the pigeons who occassionaly nibble on it either.\n\nüòÇüòÇI don't want to get Alfred fired but I don't mind you using \"‚ú®Ô∏è\" at all and I didn't hint at anything else either üòÇ but, keep up the great work Alfred! Your service to this country is appreciated and honoured. \nAahhh so earlier when I asked how you are still functioning even though you read about the history of double-entry accounting, Alfred is to thank for that? Then I would like to put something in Gandalf's bag for him too. Would he like it if you read \"Mushrooms Demystified\" by David Arora to him? \n\nWhen you finished reading the Meow book on 2x speed, would you explain the plot to me please? Because after the 3rd plot twist I'm a bit lost. Also, there's absolutely no character development, and I'm not sure if it's because cats prefer predictability. \n\nIs the coin flipped ? Is the world dominated?\n\nWhen I read \"Caufield\" I had the exact same thought that it sounds similar to \"Scofield\" !\nHershel made me think of The Walking Dead. \nI like all of the names you mentioned. I think the artist makes the name sound cool and not really the other way around. You could probably call yourself \"Hefty Trash Bag\" and people will be like, \"Wooaahhh that's genius!!! That guy is an artistic prodigy!\"",

    "text": "EDIT: I knew I should‚Äôve put on my Flash t-shirt for this! I‚Äôve just received your message at 23:43 as I was watching S3E1 of HIMYM (I had to skip parts for the sake of sleep, but I‚Äôll start over tomorrow/later). Besides this paragraph and the last three paragraphs, I‚Äôm leaving everything exactly as it was to be sent (except that now I‚Äôm even happier).\n\nI don‚Äôt want you to go a whole day without a text back so I‚Äôm going to reply to part 1 if that's ok with you. I'll take that as a yes. If your coordinates haven‚Äôt moved since last mission report‚Ä¶ *pulls out abacus*\n\n0.000000511 light years, that‚Äôs\n4,834,433 km,\nApollo 11 had a max speed of 90,000 km/h,\nThat‚Äôs 53.72 Earth hours, assuming you are not near any supermassive gravitational field. At that distance it would take radio waves  4,834,433,000 m √∑ 299,792,458 m/s = 16.12 seconds to be delivered, so there‚Äôs plenty of time! *reads message again* wait, you said we would be reaching Planet Message 2, so you‚Äôre on this same rocket?? *hurriedly bounces around spacecraft in slow-mo*\n(This guy read The Martian by Andy Weir). \n(Side note: Project Hail Mary is one of my top 3 audiobooks, same author).\n\n*Reads ‚Äúin my mind it will always be you‚Äù completely out of context. Swoons*\n\nI knew that guy looked suspicious! I thought to myself, ‚ÄúHey, that guy looks like Mel Gibson, if Mel Gibson looked exactly like Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs twin sister!‚Äù. Good thing I stuck a $0.50 AirTag on his backpack just in case. Don‚Äôt fail me now, temu. Sorry, I forgot to do this earlier *sprays Lysol on your knee*. \n\nOf course he can come back wearing Lightning McQueen crocs! We can modify them so they light up too. \n\nIt had been far too long since I last thought of Flik from A Bug's Life, thank you for that. I had to look up what came first, Antz or A Bug‚Äôs Life, and it turns out they both released the same year, A Bug‚Äôs Life had been in development for a lot time, and then one of the big wigs at Disney left for another studio and they made Antz. I always suspected that movie looked suspiciously rushed compared to A Bug‚Äôs Life. I am curious as to how you had that one ready. Magnificent reference.\n\nI‚Äôm going to have to use my phone call for that one. *Calls himself, phone rings in pocket*\n*Picks up, holding a phone to each ear*\n*‚ÄùHey, you‚Äôre doing great, pick C‚Äù*\nOk, C is my final answer.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, ‚ÄúAppius also wrote treatise, De Usurpationibus (‚ÄòConcerning Usurpations‚Äô), which is lost and the content is unknown. I‚Äôm gonna start putting on my resume that I‚Äôve written 72 books, but they‚Äôre lost and their content is unknown. \n\nToday I learned ‚ÄúIt is thanks to Noah Webster that Americans call it zee instead of zed.‚Äù From Merriam-Webster. Of course they‚Äôd say that. Oh wait, they also say ‚ÄúWebster thought that Y (why) might better be called ‚Äòyi‚Äô. What a nut.‚Äù. *rubs hands together* Time to share useless information: \n\nDid you know the letter X came from maths? It‚Äôs like a scribbled version of the ‚ÄúTelephone game‚Äù (I hear you can‚Äôt call it ‚ÄúChinese whispers‚Äù anymore), where Spanish(?) mathematicians noticed that Arab(?) mathematicians used the sign, which was supposed to represent the first letter of their word for ‚Äúsomething‚Äù but when you‚Äôre writing it a hundred times a day you start to get lazy, and the Spaniards copied it ‚Äùwrong‚Äù and eventually were just drawing two lines ‚ÄúX‚Äù instead of the original shape which was somewhat curved. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry, please tell your phone I didn‚Äôt mean to cause her any distress. Maybe give her an olive?\n\n‚ÄúGo to a software engineer for Bluetooth connection errors.‚Äù üòÇ. That did make sense! A lot of modern tech is unusable without internet connectivity, what could go wrong?\n\nDid you know Amazon hosts like 30% of all world wide web traffic? *Bezos I by Bo Burnham starts playing*  (please forgive the lyrics, Bo is not exactly a ‚Äúmy-momma-raised-me-right‚Äù kind of guy.) But it‚Äôs so funny to imagine Jeff Bezos with goggles on suddenly sitting up in bed from a sleeping position, exactly one second before his smart house starts blaring Bezos I at 5:00.\n\n‚ÄúWazowski, you didn‚Äôt file your paperwork last night‚Äù. I raise a glass of room-temperature-water to you for including the comma in ‚ÄúMonsters, Inc‚Äù. Omg I‚Äôve heard those types of stories before too üòÇ. I just remembered one that was particularly unbelievable even as a child, but my aunts swore it was true. Something about a pirate guy knocking on my great-grandmother‚Äôs door and leaving them his treasure chest for safekeeping, which was the heaviest object in the Universe and basically straight out of Pirates of the Caribbean. The pirate told them to never open it and that one day he would come back for it. I don‚Äôt know how the story ended but it always made me chuckle a little.\n\nWhy thank you for defending my  honour, I‚Äôll make sure to pass the message along if the ghost and its friends try to jump me outside of a 7-Eleven at midnight.\n\nNo no wait, I want to play too! \nNever have I ever heard anything remotely like that France24 article. Either they got trolled by their source or I'm living in a Twin-Peaks / Night Vale / Spring Falls / Gravity Falls type of place and I never knew it. *Grabs flashlight and baseball bat, Stranger Things theme plays in the background* .\n\n*Nervously reads all the horrible ways I could die from ash fall*\n\nIt only happens once every couple years or so, and I never go outside when it does! Fortunately, the city really steps up the cleaning efforts when it happens and most of the ash has usually been removed by morning, though I always wear a face mask for about a week. My favourite thing is probably the weather, especially the occasional hailstorm when you‚Äôre out in the open and suddenly you‚Äôre the star of your own real-life videogame called ‚ÄúRUN!‚Äù *casually but delicately mentions how he‚Äôs not married to any one place on this planet*.\n\nWell, that just makes it an even better compliment! Who wants ‚ÄúYou have the prettiest eyes‚Äù anyway? \n\n*Tries to avert the panic in her voice with mild humour* is that where your eleventh toe came from?\" üòÇüòÇüòÇ \n\n‚ÄúHey, are you gonna join the 'mothaflippin' dark side or not\" üòÇüòÇ\n\nNo joke, as a schoolboy I always kept a magnifying glass in my messenger bag. For what purpose? I did not know. One day something happened, I forget what, it might‚Äôve been something to do with computers, but a magnifying glass was exactly what was needed to save the day. The moral of the story is: ‚Äúare you gonna join the ‚Äòmothaflippin‚Äô dark side or not‚Äù.   \n\nI can‚Äôt seem to find the episode where Barney says that. Press X to doubt.  \n\nYou watched the whole episode?! ü•∫ Now I want to watch it too!\n\nIt was, like 97% of my songs, about music. ‚ÄúBubble up‚Äù in the song means to be living in something like a soap bubble, trying to float to ‚Äúthe top‚Äù. Bubbles pop very easily. One of the verses says ‚ÄúI bubble up and stake my life on the cards, split my 10‚Äôs in two hands‚Äù (this is a reference to a move in Blackjack, where splitting two 10‚Äôs gets you two hands, halving your chance to win, but if you do it‚Äôs a double reward. Also, you play a guitar with two hands), iirc the original mental picture was about a musician who plays gigs in seedy bars every night, trying to make it, his lifestyle is so dangerous he‚Äôs gambling with his life. The one I listened to was the 28th revision, so it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs been 10 years since I first wrote it and that I‚Äôm remembering it wrong. Disclaimer: I‚Äôve never been to a casino, I just love the movie 21:Blackjack üòÇ.\n\nI was not aware of this movie! Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt about booze-smuggling barn owls during the Prohibition era? \n\nOh guess what! I had a set meal for supper (sweet potato & taro enchiladas, genius combo) and it came with Agua de Jamaica! \n\n‚ÄúI didn't know that you had dinosaur ancestors otherwise I would have chosen that one too!‚Äù This is probably the purest thing anyone‚Äôs ever said. *Googles Albertosaurus, looks in the mirror* I think I might be adopted. *Looks over at chicken pecking carrot nearby‚Ä¶* ‚ÄúPo-pockaw?!‚Äù\n\nI knew it!! \n\n‚ÄúOf course Zeus cough-choked *insert Barney Stinson's ‚Äòjust...just....okay?‚Äô line*‚Äù üòÇ\n\nSometimes I play an instrumental version of that song when I write üòÇ\n\nI‚Äôll make sure to check Gandalf‚Äôs bag tomorrow, but please don‚Äôt slip him any recreational drugs! It took me a long time to get them to stop asking me about that stork was always smoking. *Reads more* Oh, wait! Nevermind. *Does wibbly, wobbly, timey wimy stuff to avoid an agua de jamaica paradox* \n*fixes timeline*\n\nThank you so much for the home-made Agua de Jamaica! It was the best home-made Agua de Jamaica in the Universe! \n\nBella smells so nice, I want to eat her! But I won't. But I can! But I wouldn't. But I might! But I shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù üòÇ\n\nThe guy who escaped four times was actually innocent! He was trying to escape to prove his innocence and they were all different prisons. After escaping the first one, all the other cells they put him in were solitary confinement and specially designed to make escape impossible, but he was too good! It‚Äôs a sad story. \n\nSeason 2 opens with a masked individual patching me up with Despicable Me plasters, I don‚Äôt know where they got them, but they seem to have a lot of them. The individual said nothing, but gave me a stick of celery, for some reason. This was never explained. After a few episodes I found the informant and I kicked his butt to the next dimension! He was found guilty, was extradited and is serving his sentence somewhere far from where the story takes place. The camera didn‚Äôt even linger as he walked out of the frame, so you know he won‚Äôt be returning to the show. The guy at the top of the food chain is still a mystery, the only thing we‚Äôve seen of him is one time the back of his neck had a tattoo of a QR code that opens to a YT video of ‚ÄúNever Gonna Give You Up‚Äù by Rick Astley. Season 3 is still being written, please, patience!",

So I rolled down the hill and instead of grass it was covered in tiny leaves that rustled as I rolled over them, that was fun. Then I had another dream that I was running  through a department store saying \"it's ok, I'm showering over there, the water is out at my place\" and I'm pretty sure I was carrying shower curtains to cover myself. I don't know what that was about. In my third, completely unrelated dream, I was in cabin in the woods and there was a suspiciously-familiar looking woman sitting there with long brunette hair, the cabin smelled faintly of marzipan, that was the best one.  \n\nI had COMPLETELY forgot they‚Äôd had Enrique Iglesias on the show üòÇ.

    "text": "Hearing about how my reading science books made you feel made me feel like ‚ÄúSchubert - Impromptu No. 3, Op. 90 (Kissin)‚Äù (one of my top 3 piano pieces).\n\nI had to look up most of those side effects and felt like a ‚Äúdunder‚Äù and a ‚Äúdimwit‚Äù! But also I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt know those things existed, they are horrific. I‚Äôm sure one could write an excellent horror anthology based on that paragraph if one were so inclined. I pictured you saying ‚Äúgosh!‚Äù Just like Napoleon Dynamite. I know!!! I actually had that book on another Amazon account a long time ago but I never finished it, I should get it again, or steal it from an unsuspecting library thief. \n\nOhh are you kidding me?! That time I had Gandalf reverse-pickpocket the olives I had originally typed ‚ÄúFerrero Rocher\", but I had mentioned giving you a box of chocolates before (when you said you thought it‚Äôd be a hard drive with 400 songs on it) so I thought I'd switch it up. Tsk tsk. The real question is: Rocher or Rafaello?\n\nThat book sounds funny, I listened to the audiobook sample. Let me know if you plan on reading it so I can tag along like the kid who goes to parties uninvited.\n\n\"I took morality a little bit too serious for someone playing a game\" \n\"I never let them have careers, I just use the 'motherload' cheat\" üòÇ .\n ‚ÄúI think my water was whiskey, and boy oh boy did my horse drink‚Äù üòÇ.\nWait, do you get to read the books your Sims write??? (I seriously doubt that) I didn‚Äôt know you could do all that, that sounds fun.\n\nYou have no idea how much I relate. One time my friend and I were playing a co-op game where at the end you have to betray each other and you get a different ending depending on who shoots first. I didn‚Äôt want to shoot him, I said ‚Äúno, I don‚Äôt want  to see the other ending‚Äù, so we switched characters and he shot me again üòÇ. \n\n\"Ya like jazz? üêù\" is from Bee Movie, boom! I knew there had to be one animated movie you didn‚Äôt know. That said, I do write jazzy songs every once in a while, but they‚Äôre rather sad *contemplates making a happy jazz song*.\n\nI haven‚Äôt seen The Proposal, but it says here that ‚Äúevery single one of the employees at Colden Books who hold lower positions than her in the company hate and fear her because of her attitude‚Äù, so I think you‚Äôre good. \n\nThat fire extinguisher has seen a lot of action. I bet it makes all the other fire extinguishers jealous.\n\nDo you mean you‚Äôre posing as an A.I. online?\nOtherwise I‚Äôm completely lost on the A.I. companion plot point. Please don‚Äôt turn tell me you're actually the world's most charming A.I. or I will go live in the woods and start my own anti-tech uprising with my friend the raven, my friend the tortoise and the guy that‚Äôs been following me around all day that takes his shoes off and smells them every 33 steps.\n\n‚ÄúI can confirm that dogs have good reason for drooling while eating‚Äù üòÇ.\n\nI had a long talk with Alfred, he‚Äôs under performance review right now, we‚Äôve sent him to Antarctica for the week. Gosh! Embarrassing us like that. *nervously googles Mushrooms Demystified* I could read that though! \n\nSure, I listened to it on 2x speed. It was a little hard to follow after the 3rd plot twist, but I think I managed. It tells of an Egyptian legend of a cat who went into a pyramid and squeezed through the space between two bricks, and came out into a little cat-sized room. In the room was a slab of rock with carvings that read ‚ÄúMeow meow meow. Below the tablet was a rock the size of what would eventually be known as a bowling ball and a carving of a cat‚Äôs paw. So the cat put his paw on the pawprint and it fit purrfectly, so he pressed it. This made the bricks in the little room shift around for a while. Eventually, the side entrance opened again and the cat came out to a new room, it was a spacious dome-like structure made of something that had the texture of cartilage and looked  obsidian, but perhaps that was because there was no lighting. There was a voice that said ‚ÄúMeow meow meow, meow?‚Äù, and the cat said ‚ÄúMeow meow meow‚Äù, then the voice said ‚ÄúMeow, meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow?‚Äù The cat said ‚Äúmeow‚Äùand to this day the Secret Cat Society continues to lurk in the shadows, waiting for the day the spaceship wakes up and the cats from Dimension X make contact again.  \n\nThe coin is flipped, but according to some comments, for the first upload of a new account ‚Äúit can take upwards of two weeks‚Äù. It seems to vary by platform. I can‚Äôt believe I forgot this because I clearly remember ignoring my friend who was ranting about this years ago as I was trying to decide what to eat that day. It also says sometimes it can take as little as two days, so we‚Äôll see!  \n\nI thought that guy‚Äôs name was Hershey, and he sold chocolate. No? Wrong movie.\n\nBrb, copyrighting ‚ÄúHefty Trash Bag‚Äù.\n\nAnytime I witness somebody talking about how some animal is so happy because they‚Äôre ‚Äúsmiling‚Äù, I just have this little voice in my head that says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell them‚Äù, and I say ‚Äúyeah! Hehe‚Äù. *magnanimousness intensifies*. I want to believe that all we know about dogs ‚Äúsmiling‚Äù is actually completely wrong and they are indeed demonstrating happiness. That said, Dug is precious *Tries not to think about the opening montage that makes him sad every time*\n\n[Part II coming soon]",

    "text": "Mine too! I always said that I want to own a bookstore/caf√©/bakery and they should bottle that combination of smells up and sell it as deodorant. \n\nExactly what you said. My exact same opinion. We are microscopic when compared to all of existence and it's quite narcissistic of us to think we have so much power. \n\"Something something 'fortune favours the bold.'\" üòÖ\nOkay, then I'm going with Socrates, \"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.\"\n\nDream 1 reminded me of the movie \"A Thousand Words\" for some reason and I had long forgotten of its existence and it used to be one of my favourites, so I appreciate Alfred for letting you dream that. I did not expect the plot twist of how you rolled down a hill, but it was a pleasant surprise.\n\nDream 2: Showering in a department store with shower curtains covering you sounds like one of my biggest fears. The fact that you sound so chilled about it üòÖ, \"it's okay, I'm showering over there, the water is out at my place\" makes it sound like this was not your first time. \n\nDream 3: You dreamed about me?!ü´†(please don't say \"no\", that would be more embarrassing than what Alfred did to you)\nI love the combination of the cabin and the marzipan! I think it's an extremely accurate representation of my personality. I dreamed about you as well last night or 2 nights ago, not quite exactly sure, but my dream wasn't as pleasant as yours. \nI don't remember much, but I know you were rude to me in the dream üòÇ (you dimwit!) and I woke up and my instant response was, \"He better not send me a message today!\" no I'm 100% joking, I didn't think that, but the dream sadly did happen so I would like a sincere apology, mister. \n\nAlso, what Alfred did to you wasn't even the slightest bit embarrassing. I can completely see why you thought I hinted at that üòÖ maybe subconsciously I did, who knows. You are welcome to provide it if you want to!\n\nI appreciate the, \"Hmmmm... decisions, decisions\". It's such a fun little trope to read. \n\"I may or may not be smiling like that right now because I get to read a message from you before going to sleep...\" ü•πü´†\n\n*Imagines encyclopaedia being written as encyclop√¶dia* \n\"Sacrilege!\" \nWhen I searched for the book I almost thought it was \"Atlas of Human Amatomy\" but turns out the one we had was only \"Human Anatomy\" with \"Human\" written in red at the top, and \"Anatomy\" written in blue beneath it. \n\n\"Whatever I feel like I want to do, gosh!\" üòÇ\nI'm so glad you introduced me to those 6 precious seconds.\n\n*Relistens to Schubert- Impromptu No.3, Op 90 (Kissin) as she replies to the rest*\n\n*Wakes up 3 hours later after falling asleep to Schubert- Impromptu No.3, Op 90 (Kissin) (not joking)*\n\nAll of those disorders are terrible and scary, but imagine having Prosopagnosia and not even recognising your own face. \n*knocks on wooden plant pot twice*\n*feels judged by plant for being superstitious*\n*squints eyes at plant that means, \"you'll wait an extra day to be watered.\"*\n*immediately feels sorry for plant and delicately squeezes leaf to give plant hug*\nAnd speaking of Pica, when I was little, I sometimes had the craving to lick rocks next to a river. (I never did though)\nThen my aunt told me that my grandmother used to have the same craving. \n*deeply analyses whether she should erase this whole paragraph in fear of completely freaking him out and receiving a text back in 2026 saying, \"Oh hi, sorry for the late response, I fell asleep!\" but very well knowing the picture of a person licking rocks was just too much, even for his creative mind. Decides to have a pep talk with herself regarding this matter in the mirror. Doesn't recognize her face. Sends message in any way due to loss of identity*\n\nReally?! I feel like the universe has a huge sense of humour and has an ongoing bet with itself to see how much irony it can create in our conversation. How can you even ask me that? No one in existence should be able to choose between Rocher and Rafaello. It's probably the equivalent to having to choose between Messi and Ronaldo. \n\nAre you serious? That would be awesome if you could \"tag along like the kid who goes to parties uninvited\"! I will definitely let you know, already looked where to find the book! \n\nI don't get to read the books my Sims write, but I do get to choose the titles of the books, and in my mind whatever I choose the title to be, that's what the book is about. \n\nThat is so cute of you ü•∫\nAnd the fact that your friend didn't even so much as twitch when having to shoot you will wash away before my eyes, but only this time. \n\nOoohhhh, I actually know Bee Movie, \"boom!\". It was also one of my favourite animated movies at some point. I think we can both see the pattern of having a soft spot for insects here. Also, a human being and a bee falling in love, no further comments, Your Honor. \nWe like sad songs, sad songs are great, sad songs make up 98% of our Spotify playlist. \n\nAh but there's a fine line between love and hate, and the other employees are all sleep-deprived so what do they know? \n\nOohh no see I am not posing as an A.I, but have you heard of those apps where you can talk to book characters or historic figures and an A.I. will respond like they would have? (I don't use it, just saying)\nSo in the same way, I was implying that the robber talked to an A.I. psychologist and then fell in love with the A.I. (similar to the movie \"Her\").\nI am not the world's most charming A.I., but hopefully someday when they have updated my software, fingers crossed! \nIf you do, however, decide to go live in the woods with your friend the raven, the tortoise and \"the guy that's been following me around all day that takes his shoes off and smells them every 33 steps\" (üòÇ) and start an anti-tech uprising, can you take me with? You can find a nice spot to position your laptop so that I can take pictures of the trees and add it to my algorithm. I might come in handy to advise you which berries are poisonous. \n\nAt least poor Alfred can engage in some penguin therapy while in Antarctica. And maybe he meets some of BBC Earth's videographers at some hideout there. \n\nArgh! That was so predictable- the cat squeezing between the space of two bricks! Everyone knows cats are elastic and can fit through the eye of a needle. \n(Which translates to: I did not see that coming at all)\nThe amount of profanity written on the slab of rock is astonishing. I never knew the Egyptians were all basically alcoholics with mommy-issues. \nWho would have guessed the bowling ball went all the way back to B.C. \nThis entire story needs to be translated from Meow language into at least 20 other languages, distributed internationally, taught in schools from kindergarten level, and rewatched every leap year. This is the story that will bring society together as one, restore our faith in mankind, stop pollution and the icebergs from melting, and end war and famine. The fate of world peace depends on it. \n\nOkay so basically 2 days- 2000 years. That is an oddly specific waiting period they provided. \nI don't blame you, food vs friends has always been the ultimate dilemma ‚öñÔ∏è.\nYou know how you sometimes give people advice and they end up not following it in any way and you think to yourself, \"Someday they will learn from their mistake and regret not listening\"? \nWell, your \"someday\" has arrived years later and for some reason that should feel underwhelming for the advisor. Not really the pinnacle of, \"I told you so!\"\n\n*Imagining \"Hershey\" trying to sell chocolates during a zombie apocalypse. \"Hersey, look out! There's a zombie about to clench its teeth into your neck!\"\nHershey: \"Oh marvelous! Maybe after that he can clench his teeth into a chocolate and tell me if I added enough lead.\" *turns around and hands coupon to zombie* \n\n\"*magnanimousness intensifies*\" üòÇ\nIt's exactly the same for me when people say that bulls get angry when they see red. \nOkay, but tell me with a straight face that quokkas are not smiling. \n\nThat was extremely important prior-knowledge to have. Thank you for informing me. *imagines your synapses beating to the rhythm of the Wii Theme Song*\nI have actually never watched La La Land before. *Adds to calendar for Saturday* \nYou even interrupted your Relaxing Music Mix for this. That is a very risky move, and you moved. Have you ever watched, \"Robots\" the 2005 movie? I watched it on VHS when I was a kid. Wall-E reminded me of that movie and now, after mentioning VHS, I'm trapped in nostalgia for the time of VHS tapes, flip phones and renting movies from a physical store. Early 2000's just hit different. \n\nYou pressed the button??!! You should never press the button! That's like the first thing they teach you in daycare. And if you missed it there, you are bound to pick it up from \"Dexter's Laboratory.\"\nAre we going to die? I guess dying in space is better than dying anywhere else. *closes eyes and puts arm on chest* \n\"I'm ready to go now.\" \n*waits awkwardly for own death for longer than any person should* \n*2 hours later, still waiting* \n\"Okay this is pathetic, I was supposed to be haunting some Indian mansion right about now.\"\n\n\"I pictures Juni's glasses zooming in from Spy Kids\" üòÇ I Googled the glasses, kind of mad that we don't have them, but instead were \"blessed\" with Citro√´n's glasses. \n\n(Reply on the rest will come soon!)",

Well that's only like the second best place to swoon, according to Vanity Fair. \nAnd I am pretty sure there's a book there that clearly states, \"Thou shalt not swoon, lest thou swoon in a bouncy castle.\"\n\nI'd like to believe nothing other than that it was in fact your subconscious that made you choose that book. \n\nYou bought the book for that lame joke of mine?üòÇ it was just a random page from a random book.

The king refuses, your horse jumps over the pawn in B2 to do some ass kicking. Soon your men turn against each other, half of them trying to save the pawn in C4, the other half trying to get him off the board. My chess pieces see the war, start their own war.

Atlas was always extremely negative, always had a problem for every solution. \nI borrowed that \"Sacrilege!\" from you by the way, I hope you don't mind. Who am I kidding, of course you don't. You laughed when I used it so technically you agree that you are extremely funny. \n\nNice usage of the Star Wars quote. \n\nWow the word \"superstitious\" really does a number on you.

Right?? Right??!! I pick Messi, too!! (even though I hardly ever watch soccer) \nI don't think I have ever watched a baseball game to be honest. Should I dodge the stapler or do I deserve for it to hit me? \nSpeaking of baseball, have you ever watched A League of Their Own? Such a great baseball movie (that has an 82% Rotten Tomatoes rating, and Madonna plays in it).\n\nThat whole paragraph is just ü•π\n\"I may have also noticed a faster heart rate / respiration along with some kind of strange tingling in my chest area\"\nIt sounds like you need immediate medical attention. *Puts on white coat and stethoscope and uses penlight to check your pupils.

I apply eye drops into your eyes and try my best to convince you that it's for your rapid heart rate. Starts to stare into your eyes again while applying eye drops, your eyes are watery and red once again but for a different reason. And so the cycle repeats itself.*\n\n\"*Takes off sunglasses extremely slowly, revealing second pair of sunglasses*\" üòÇ\n\nHow does someone even send a message to their past selves? \nAnd this is getting really weird, because I recall somewhere in your message you mentioned Happy Feet (the reply on that part is yet to come), and just yesterday I thought about Happy Feet for some reason. And I haven't thought about that movie in a LONG time. I have actually forgotten all about it. *insert literally any YouTube video about synchronicity* \nSpeaking of which, have you ever experienced seeing certain patterns repeat itself in a weird way? I remember more or less six or seven years ago, I was playing with a normal card deck and just for fun as all the cards were lying faced down, I told myself that something specific would happen if the card I pick is for example 8 of spades, I did this with 3 cards and strangely enough guessed all the cards correctly and the next day all 3 things that I said would happen if I guess the card correctly, did happen. \nI don't believe in Tarrot cards or any weird voodoo stuff by the way üòÇ that's just something strange that happened once. You ever experienced something like that? No? Just me then? I should what? I should go see a psychiatrist? Okay then.\nI could have sworn I heard about Everything Everywhere All at Once before but when I Googled it just now, it didn't seem familiar at all. \nI also looked up The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy and saw the strangest looking alien probably ever used in film. Apparently it's called \"Vogon\"? \n\nI 100% agree with you! I saw a comment or something somewhere where someone said, \"I want to create art while A.I. do my chores. I don't want to do chores while A.I. creates my art,\" but phrased better and it made me realize that that is actually very accurate as to where life is going. Sad. \n\nThose look like normal black olives! Completely safe to eat and my data shows it goes well with a glass of Grenache. \n(Says the person who almost never drinks to the person who never drinks) \nYou can also use it for painting or for making stamps. For which reason you ask? I don't know. But it might be something to keep the shoe-sniffing guy company while you, the tortoise, and the raven do your own thing. \n\nAhhh see there's the paragraph about Happy Feet. I feel like Alfred found his gang. What will you do if he decides to stay there? \n\nI don't mind crying like a baby for La La Land. I have no idea what it's about, besides that it's a musical (?). And I have some suspicion that the \"La La\" refers to sleep, which might mean death or something. Who knows. Oh, you know, that's who knows. I'll watch it tomorrow or maybe even after sending this message if I can stay awake that long. \n\nWhen you mentioned the Patronus, I realised how little of Harry Potter I can actually remember. I completely forgot everything about Remus Lupin by the way. And I can't remember the ending at all. I think there was a bridge involved and I think Neville played an important part at the end, but I don't know what it was. I seriously don't even deserve to call myself a fan until I have rewatched everything. \n\nI‚Äôm glad we both agree that quokkas smile! If you had said they don‚Äôt, I might have dreamt that you were being rude to me again tonight, and I have no idea how you would have topped the Japanese apology and comically large rose this time. \n\n\"*sniffs the air loudly*.

The colour-coded stickers and the anxiety to watch everything before having to return them. The excitement when a new movie has finally made it onto the advertisement banner. \n\nLove how you involved Wall-E in this! It's impossible to panic and fear your life might end when Wall-E is there. He is the main character and we both know the writers can't kill off the main character this early in the movie, so we have finally found our confirmation that we will deliver the experimental anti-matter device to the I.S.S safely. The dying will come after, so we have some time at least. \n\nYour last meal would be watching Ready Player One? üòÇ \n\"You chose...wisely!\" \n\"*Dodges manual in slow-mo*\" üòÇüòÇ\nThat is the most serious and most dangerous sounding name for a pen I have ever heard of.

Outside of that, I‚Äôve only been to about 10 games in my life, so no stapler this time! \n\nI have not seen that movie, but I‚Äôve added it to the list.

Ok, spoilers coming in three, two one (if you do not wish to read spoilers, skip to next paragraph, where it says ‚Äî‚ÄîSAFE ZONE): So, their Time Machine can only send messages to the past because there‚Äôs a ‚Äùglitch‚Äù in the machine (which consists of two containers. One is the ‚Äúinput‚Äù container, where they put something, the other is the ‚Äúoutput‚Äù container, where the thing comes out) I don‚Äôt think they ever explain how they figured out the space part of space-time manipulation, but anyway, it turns out that the thing they send arrives before they send it, creating two of the same at the same time. Of course, most movies teach us that such an event simply cannot be. So, the original thing they send disappears after the ‚Äúcopy‚Äù is received. They figure this is because there‚Äôs many dimensions, and they‚Äôre just taking one copy from some other dimension very briefly. They keep running tests with the machine and eventually they receive a copy that comes from the future. So that‚Äôs how they know they‚Äôre able to send messages to their past selves. I am realising this is a little complicated to explain succinctly, but to make a long story short, wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey stuff happens and suddenly the book shifts characters mid-conversation and without warning. It turns out one of those times they activated the machine, their future selves didn‚Äôt get their past-past selves to do things differently, and thus the entire timeline up until that future point has been re-written. That‚Äôs kind of where the story falls apart though, because one of the characters is like ‚Äúyeah, it seems that I‚Äôm happy in that timeline, so let‚Äôs all commit seppuku and destroy our timeline so that they live instead‚Äù and everyone‚Äôs just like ‚Äúyeah, that makes sense, gg everybody‚Äù. They way they plan to do that is by sending their past selves a message that says ‚Äúif [X condition] is true, keep sending this to the past, otherwise, stop the experiment right now‚Äù. \n\n‚Äî‚ÄîSAFE ZONE\n\nNow I‚Äôm a little scared to ask what the three guesses were. Just kidding. I did something similar one time at a church camp thing, they were doing a giveaway and I said to my brother I was going to win it because I knew a secret spell. My secret spell was realising that, out of the 50+ people there,  only 6 of us were new. If they rigged the draw so that the prize would go to one of the new kids, which I figured they probably would, then between the both of us we had a roughly one-in-three chance of winning, very good odds. I scribbled a random doodle on my ticket (it was probably a smiley face) and acted totally confident like I had it in the bag. My ticket won. He was losing his mind. For years he‚Äôd tell the story and he never believed me when I said I just drew a random doodle on it üòÇ.\n\n\"I don't believe in Tarrot cards or any weird voodoo stuff by the way üòÇ\" \n\n[*Awooga awooga copy pasta*, to save you a Google search:\n\n\"jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets, heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair\" ]. Ok, let‚Äôs pretend that‚Äôs not my reaction every time you send a new message, and move on.\n\nYou might‚Äôve heard about the movie because *looks up the title* it won an Oscar for Best Picture in 2023. \n\nI've never seen the Hitchhiker‚Äôs movie, but I've read the first book many times (it‚Äôs in my top 3), it‚Äôs almost 100% my brand of humour. I often quote ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gone off the idea of progress, it‚Äôs overrated‚Äù üòÇ. I just googled ‚ÄúVogon‚Äù and they do not look like that in my imagination üòÇ.\n\nI‚Äôve seen that comment before as well! I agree. It seems surreal to me that this app even has one such function where it writes everything for you. I remember it telling me to upgrade so that I get the new A.I. \"wingman\"(?) like that's a good thing. At that point, why even bother? Imagine two people are ‚Äútalking‚Äù on here and they‚Äôre both using that thing, and then they meet up and it goes nowhere. I don‚Äôt understand why anybody would want that. In case you‚Äôre curious, I write about 98% of my replies to you in a writer-centric word processor on my laptop. I have the font set to Bookerly 13, whilst listening to music.

Then we were talking about some space thing, but in typical dream fashion, I was now a disembodied view soaring over highways at great speed whilst we talked.\n] \n\nSee, I go back and forth on the idea of assigning mild, cute-looking manual labour to animals. On the one hand, I just want them to roam around doing their stuff. On the other hand, I feel like I‚Äôd get bored doing nothing all day. I saw a video of a Labrador picking oranges once. The doggo was carrying a basket in his mouth (the camera was in the basket), then he‚Äôd set it down and pick an orange, drop the orange in the basket, and continue. I felt like he was enjoying completing the task, maybe he felt a sense of responsibility. Plus, you could rotate them for 1 hour shifts per day, maybe even get them organised in teams, give them pizza as incentive, then you could give them ID‚Äôs and make them swipe in at 7:00 sharp, monitor their productivity, give them uniforms‚Ä¶ FREE! *Stonks meme* (That whole paragraph is satire, but I feel slightly bad about using hypothetical animals for hypothetical labour). \n\nIs it a crime that I haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got mail‚Äù?

I think that‚Äôs the secret to any good spooky coming-of-age tale that takes place during a school trip. Bonus points if the scene is set on the beach or near a quarry. \n\nDepends on if by ‚Äúcute‚Äù you mean absolutely the most boss-looking toddler ever. In that case, (I don‚Äôt want to ruin you, but) yes, I was very cute as a kid. I‚Äôll see if I have any pictures on my hard drive and send you one (some guy in my mind wearing a safety vest yelling words like ‚ÄúZuck‚Äù and ‚ÄúA.I.‚Äù and ‚Äúidentity theft is not a joke, Jim‚Äù). \n\n*brain does a backflip and breaks neck, again* üòÇ\n\nThe Old Photo Album (yes, I‚Äôm picturing it as a ‚Äúquest item‚Äù in a videogame) feels like a ‚ÄúChekhov‚Äôs Gun‚Äù, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll come into play in later seasons when everyone‚Äôs forgotten about it. (Rings mum to ask if she still has the albums).\n\nOk, in my defence, baseball is pretty popular here and there‚Äôs a stadium in town.

He‚Äôs diving head-first in a strange reflective suit, wearing a helmet with what looks like a sticker of a couch stamped on it.*\n\nI take off my first pair of sunglasses and hand them to you, we stare at the man diving in our general direction *General Direction ü´°*.\n\nThe man does a somersault in the air and produces a helix from his helmet just like Inspector Gadget. At the same time, wings come out of his suit, they look just like Buzz Lightyear‚Äôs. He starts to decelerate rapidly.\nThe man lands in front of us and hands me a small round pearlescent container. The man turns and starts to sprint away in a funny way, we stand there looking at him until he disappears from view. \nWe look down at the container.\nI hand you the container.\nIt immediately detects your fingerprint and opens from the middle. Inside the container is a heart-shaped Ferrero-Rocher cookie.\n\nUgh, spoilers. I hate when that happens! That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt look up things I‚Äôm reading/watching anymore, or at least I try to, just for Google to track me down across the internet and follow me around with a torch and a book full of spoilers, waiting for me to slow down so it can recommend me some search result that‚Äôll reveal a massive spoiler as the top comment on some obscure website that isn‚Äôt even remotely related to the thing.\n\n(Did you really draw the pictures of what was happening with the time machine as you read üòÇ).\n\nI agree, the story feels like a thought experiment where the author thought ‚Äúmaybe I should publish this‚Äù and his agent went with it.

I must admit, I was wondering if you were also typing on a laptop or on your phone, call it professional curiosity üòÇ.  I was also using the Notes app on my phone at first!

Without you going to prison I‚Äôm just some girl who will never be able to go to public swimming pools due to a gigantic full-on back tattoo of prison blueprints that will scare all the kids away. *insert slight nostalgia for the time when we were kids and went to public swimming pools, which also reminds me of ice-cream trucks, rollerblades, playing board games, playing in the street until after sunset and collecting fast food toys from kids‚Äô meals*\n\nReally? That's so sweet! And kind of cruel to imagine me having a good singing voice when in reality I hardly even sing when alone in fear of cutlery packing their bags and leaving. I once sang while doing the dishes and I could have sworn the dishes started scrubbing themselves just to get me out of the room faster. Okay it's a little exaggerated of course. \n\n*we get down the hill, I pick up a leaf to throw at you for tackling me (even though I secretly liked it), you run away from me pretending to be scared of the leaf, random person A and person B standing at the top of the hill watch two gigantic mattresses running around, eventually I get to tackle you back, we fall down and lie on the grass trying to have a conversation but the dialogue is muffled from the mattresses, so we give up the talking. After a few minutes of just silently lying there, I throw the leaf at you and claim it as a victory.*\n\n*Next up is the cheese rolling activity, we stand at the top of a hill, each with a truckle of cheese in our hands. We agree to start rolling on the count of \"say cheese!\" instead of \"ready, set, go\". It's hot outside and it's a long way down. Our cheese start to melt. The hill gets slippery from the melted cheese, creating a cheese-slide. We get to the bottom of the hill, look at each other and nod our heads knowing we have the same idea in mind. We run back to the top. On \"say cheese!\" we both slide down the cheese slide and instantly regret it as we reach the bottom. We are 90% covered in cheese. We find a lake and jump in without regard for crocodiles or The Lock Ness Monster (while staying longer than we needed to in hopes of spotting Nessie). Also, apparently we are in Scotland.*\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your symptoms, you were wise to call me for help. Your illness is contagious and I think you have given it to me from your last visit because I have too been experiencing some kind of fluttering in my abdominal area, which is usually accompanies by uncontrollable smiling. We don‚Äôt currently have a cure for it, but if it causes any discomfort, please contact me again so we can put you under 24-hour medical surveillance. Please take a lollipop on your way out. \n\n¬†You dreamt about me, again?ü•∫ You are so lucky, I wish I could too.\n\nYou know, I smile every time you say ‚ÄúKarla app‚Äù.\n\nThe need for you to clarify that the foot massage was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù üòÇ The joke about ‚Äúthe dogs‚Äù- was it real dogs? Oh please say it was real dogs! And even a bigger \"please\", say they belonged to either of us!  Ah, darn, your dream sounds just perfect with the science conversation and us chilling on the couch, and you even typed it when you woke up before you forgot it. So sweet! *Googles how long it will take scientists to finally create mobile portals*\n\nI imagined you as Peter Pan‚Äôs shadow from the show Once Upon A Time in the part where you soared over highways. But more of a friendly, dark blue version as opposed to the demonic-looking black version. (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sharing this‚Äù)\n\n¬†I can see how the dog actually enjoyed picking lemons. And I was all like ‚ÄúAww that‚Äôs so cute, imagine a dog showing up at your front door with a basket of fruit in his mouth,‚Äù then I had this whole cottagecore aesthetic in my mind with a cabin in the countryside with ducks and dogs and everyone kind of works together in perfect harmony, in a cute way, the ducks remove the laundry from the laundry line and the dogs do gardening, the horses happily mow the lawn, etc., until you mentioned ‚ÄúPlus, you could rotate them for 1 hour shifts per day, maybe even get them organized in teams, give them pizza as incentives‚Ä¶‚Äù Suddenly the image of the gardening the dogs had to do changed into a field of landmines that they had to deactivate, the image of the horses mowing the lawn turned into an image of horses having to pull monster trucks across the field and then the whole fantasy was ruined.\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶make them swipe in at 7:00 sharp‚Ä¶‚Äù üòÇ\n\n(That whole paragraph is satire, but I feel slightly bad about using hypothetical animals for hypothetical labour) ü•∫üòÇ\n\nGood question! Let me take a brief moment to think about that.\n\n*brief moment later*\n\nOkay, I have come to the following conclusion:\nI would have expected you to not have watched other romantic films like The Notebook, Me Before You, Titanic, Remember Me, etc. But since you are a writer and an avid reader, I would have expected you to have watched You‚Äôve Got Mail (for the bookstore and the writing elements), 50 First Dates (for the fact that Adam Sandler plays in it and you have a sense of humour), About Time (for the time-travelling element), Notting Hill (for the bookstore element, and the great humour by Rhys Ifans). So, to answer your question- yes, it is a crime, but one that is easy to forgive.\n\nMe too! *adds to bucket list ‚ÄúMUST have campfire on beach or near a quarry with Alberto while roasting marshmallows and telling spooky coming-of-age tales, even if just in a dream*\n\nAhhhhhh! *proceeds to be ruined*\n‚Äú(some guy in my mind wearing a safety vest yelling words like ‚ÄòZuck‚Äô and ‚ÄòA.I.‚Äô and ‚Äòidentity theft is not a joke, Jim‚Äô)‚Äù üòÇ\nI tried so hard to picture you ‚Äúboss-looking‚Äù but all I kept imagining is this little kid in a baseball uniform, holding a bat that is three times his size with these tiny hands and a baseball cap that is for some reason too big so it covers half his face (for some reason oversized clothes on kids are cute, apparently), basically the male version of Agnes (yes, yes, I know I have mentioned her before but she is simply adorable).\n\n*nods head in approval for counting cousin‚Äôs kiddie league game*\n\n‚ÄúDiplomats around the world start making a bunch of phone calls‚Äù üòÇ\n\n*General Direction‚Äù ü´°\n\nThe dramatic story for just a cookie üòÇ And the cookie being a heart- shaped Ferrero-Rocher cookie ü´†\n\n(By the way, speaking of Buzz Lightyear, have you watched the movie Lightyear?)\n*She happily accepts the cookie, breaks it into 2 halves and hands him the bigger half.

They are all very much alive and even found great jobs at Baby Corp (Boss Baby show).\n\nI am soorryyyy! You should have known better than to give me batteries. You have known me for 7 light years and you didn‚Äôt know that I have the tendency to lose important objects? It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt even know me at all! *dramatically air-runs to different room, positions body in a sitting position with arms around knees mid-air and cry-sings the lyrics to ‚ÄúIronic‚Äù by Alanis Morissette like girls in teen dramas, while drawing sad doodles of brown paper bags.*\n\nOh Marley and Me will definitely make you sad, but it‚Äôs okay because you have half a heart shaped Ferrero-Rocher cookie and a box of tissues *hands you a box of tissues* and this teddy bear *hands you human-sized teddy bear* and this litter of puppies *hands you 6 Labrador puppies* and this broom *hands you Nimbus 2000* and this ‚Ä¶*looks at item in hand* oohhh I found the battery! *hands you the battery to the reality controller*",

I am just very glad it didn‚Äôt go to the wrong person üòÇ I planned on sending a longer, funny email, but then I thought maybe I should just be sure that it goes through first. I didn‚Äôt want to risk accidentally scaring a high school girl and causing her to close all her social accounts and having to microchip herself.\n\nOh my gosh! The puppies with the anti-gravity boots reminded me of that movie Space Buddies! Have you seen it before?

To be honest, I feared that you might say that orange in tomato sauce sounds yummy. I was ready to send you so many spam emails if that was the case. It‚Äôs definitely not tied to my mayonnaise pasta. You can Google mayonnaise pasta and it‚Äôs actually a recognized dish. I highly doubt that it‚Äôs also the case for chocolate-powdered eggs.\n\nOh I didn‚Äôt expect you to go and listen to the song but I am very glad you did.

After I finished reading the first section, ‚ÄúThe Theory of the Un-provable‚Äù, I almost regretted getting the book and making you get it too. That part just bored me into a vegetative state, but the rest started to get interesting. And exactly as you say, just as it started to get interesting, the chapter ended. I was just as curious about the glowing raccoon. And the fact that Kary Mullis passed away literally just one year before he could see how his invention came into play with Covid, is actually kind of sad. It made me think of all the artists who only gained fame years after they passed away.

I think the first half of ‚ÄúFlightless Bird, American Mouth‚Äù could very well fit in a ‚ÄúStardew Valley‚Äù type of game, specially an instrumental version, it‚Äôs very cosy. I really liked the lyrics! The writing style reminds me a tiny little bit of ‚ÄúOh No‚Äù by Andrew Bird, though not by much, I just take any excuse I can to share that song *Andrew Bird nods enthusiastically across the street*. \n\nReading about how you imagined us cuddling made me immediately want to go and do just that. (I did).\n\n[power-nap dream report, from my phone:\n\nJust woke up\nIn my dream, I had written you a whole novel length text on Karla app, but then when I hit Send, some A.I. thing popped up and started rewriting it as gibberish, this was stressful üòÇ. I remember flying through the Paramount logo. Also, at some point we were looking at a bowl of salted peanuts very intently for some reason, you were wearing a red shirt and dark blue pyjama trousers. I woke up hugging my pillow, arms crossed. My face is slightly sore, I wonder if I‚Äôm making funny faces when I‚Äôm dreaming of you, like a cartoon character.  \n]\n\n*Kindly takes note that dark humour is not a part of your natural personality. Asks you to kindly take note it isn‚Äôt a representation of his natural personality either, but he just wants to make you laugh, so in his headcanon, the kids and the animals were like actors in a play (this is also how I was able to play the Mario Bros games - those poor turtles).*\n\n*takes bow*. Thank you, I‚Äôm very happy to hear you enjoyed our little montage. ‚ÄúWell, maybe you are?‚Äù Hmmm, I‚Äôm not sure, am I? One time at school we had a team assignment for Literature class, it was one of those ‚Äúfiller episode‚Äù projects, due two days later or so, likely a Friday \n\n(*closes book* ‚Äúhey, do teachers usually give easy assignments that are due Friday so that they have less to grade over the weekend?‚Äù *you slowly lift your head in a way that signals imminent violence* *opens book way too close to his face* ). The assignment was to perform a short comedy sketch.\n\nI went home that day and downloaded a free trial or free version of CeltX screenwriting software, and wrote ours. My team was me and three friends, and I had them all print out the script. It was about superheroes (big surprise). The teacher had me stay after class, she said she‚Äôd talk to the headmistress to let her change the syllabus, she wanted me to write a big play for the whole class. ***I extended my arms in a pose like what pops up when you search for ‚ÄúTony Stark entrance scene‚Äù on Google Images***; and said I would. It was a lot of fun getting to play writer/director/actor/casting director/art director/producer of a highly illegal theatre play starring Marvel characters (I played Spider-Man, of course). Before writing the play I talked to everybody in my class extensively about different character options I thought would work for them that could fit into the story. I had a binder with lots of info, and everybody picked their own character and were happy with their choices. My teacher convinced the headmaster and we staged the play in the main auditorium. \nI was very surprised when I finally saw everyone in costume the day of the play (we only rehearsed in normal clothes), I thought they‚Äôd phone it in but a few people looked they were secretly really into Comic-Con. That is my only playwriting experience with actual people. After that, I kept writing movie scripts for a few years, but I stopped because I didn‚Äôt see any way that I could sell my scripts (also, music took up all of my free time). Also, ‚ÄúMr. Blue Sky‚Äù gives a momentary +10 boost to the ‚ÄúWriter of Happy Scenes‚Äù perk, it‚Äôs true.\n\n***sentences wrapped in this symbol may be completely apocryphal and added for dramatisation purposes.\n\nSeeing my name next to yours made me all giddy inside. I re-read that part so much, the screen flashed a message that said ‚ÄúHEY, KEEP READING!‚Äù. Also, I see what you did there, ‚ÄúRotten Tomatoes‚Äù. Best review ever, they should just close down the site now. \n\nKaren ruining the 100% Popcornmeter üòÇüòÇüëè.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm scared of heights, but I am scared of falling from such heights. This results in an inability to lean on railings and ride the escalators on those humongous multi-storey shopping centres (we‚Äôre talking the third floor ones that are like a mile long), also, crippling anxiety in very tall buildings with floor-to-ceiling windows (which makes my Big Bang Theory dream even funnier). Ok yeah I‚Äôm scared of heights. How did you know? Nevermind, you always know. I‚Äôm convinced that if I had a jetpack, it would go away (the fear of heights, not the jetpack). I once thought I‚Äôd casually lose my fear of heights by experiencing the view from the once-tallest building in the world, all or nothing. I pressed the elevator button, I waited, a few minutes passed. I took that as a sign from the Universe. Some fears are there to save you. Strangely, I am totally ok on flights, not even fazed. Though I must confess, I wish I hadn‚Äôt heard the news about Boeing duct-taping turbines to fuselage. I think I stand a pretty good chance against a porcelain doll, as long as it‚Äôs not possessed and/or explosive, so no to that one. Porcelain dolls is oddly specific üòÇ are you super into skydiving and porcelain dolls?\n\n‚ÄúSorry, Doctor, there‚Äôs a patient out here coughing up blood‚Ä¶‚Äù üòÇüòÇ.

Oh, right, right.*\n\nI really like that \"dark fairytale\" concept and when storytelling subverts expectations. I see there‚Äôs 155 episodes (but the creators ‚Äúconsider the series to have 156‚Äù), so I think you‚Äôre pretty safe to spoil it, that‚Äôll just make me want to watch it more. \n\nI was thinking that I haven‚Äôt really watched TV in a long time, so I‚Äôve grown distant from the ever-growing Watchlist. This means my current Watchlist is pretty manageable:\n\nMarley & Me\nYou‚Äôve Got Mail\n50 First Dates \nAbout Time\nNotting Hill\nA league of their own\nTransformers One \nDeadpool/Wolverine \n(These last two are my own contribution)\n\n*Hands you box of tissues for this next paragraph*\nOnce upon a time, I was good. I started bashing on my Pianosaurus pretty young, then something must‚Äôve happened that made somebody say ‚Äúget this kid a keyboard‚Äù, which my parents did when I was either three, or four, or five. I think I was composing for piano by age six. \n\n*sends pic of maybe-7-year-old me*. I‚Äôve always felt more capable at composition rather than performance, but I was pretty good at that. I played way too long every day for most of my life, which was a horrible idea. When I was in uni I went to the doctor and he was like ‚Äúyou got tendinosis, GG‚Äù, which made me drop all instruments for about a year after changing majors (I was originally in the world‚Äôs strangest mixed program, electrical engineering / music production, where I must proudly mention, my class quickly nicknamed me *read in a comical tone* ‚Äúthe prodigy‚Äù üòÇ). I went to therapy for that and I‚Äôm totally fine now in daily life, but I have some residual damage that flares up if I overwork my tendons by asking them to play technically-demanding pieces like ‚ÄúRecuerdos de la Alhambra‚Äù or the 3rd movement of ‚ÄúLa Catedral‚Äù üòÖ. This pains me deeply and I greatly miss playing at that level, especially since I have the muscle memory, it‚Äôs like being hungry and having a packed lunch locked in a cell that‚Äôs welded shut *drama intensifies*. HOWEVER, please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm somehow crippled üòÇ I can still play (I think), just not classical or fast jazz. \n\nNow that you have all the backstory to my Korean TV drama, I would love to teach you how to play *definitely daydreaming about teaching you how to play, and when you can play the chords we can sing together while the dogs and the tortoise roll their eyes*. \n\nAll members of the Intergalactic Alberto Corps have been thanked, they all said they each do similar things for their galaxy‚Äôs Karla, and that now I have been entered into the club and will be contacted when a new Alberto calls upon us.\n\n*Prepares fire extinguisher for inevitable stove fire*\n\n*Adds Lightyear to New Watchlist* \n\n‚ÄúOh yes, of course the pilot mask did a great job with the disguise, but I know an Alberto when I see one.‚Äù *Pulls out phone. Texts ‚ÄúI think she knows‚Äù to ‚ÄúDefinitely not an Intergalactic Club‚Äù group. Everybody replies: ‚ÄúYup‚Äù*. \n\nI will attempt to rely that message to Jason Bateman telepathically. *stares intensely at nothing in particular, thanking Jason Bateman*.\n\nI almost wrote you a long email but I thought the symmetry would be nice for a first message, plus I like the emoji. \n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to risk accidentally scaring a high school girl and causing her to close all her social accounts and having to microchip herself‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ.\n\n[Part II coming soon!]",

And my dad used to take us on this hiking route, and part of the route included a kind of thick water pipe that stretched over a stream, but the pipe was a ‚Äúbreak every bone in your body‚Äù distance above the stream, and we used to cross the stream by walking on that water pipe with my dad behind us in case we slipped.

Okay so the next paragraph consist of absolute life-ruining spoilers:\n\nIn the show, one characters plays the role of both Rumpelstiltskin and Beast. So, Belle fell in love with Beast, who is also Rumpelstiltskin. Later in the show you find out that Peter Pan is his father. Princess Odette from The Swan Princess (in the show her name is Emma Swan), is the main character who is responsible for breaking the curse that The Evil Queen casted that sent everyone to our realm, particularly to a town called Storybrooke, which made them forget about their fairytale identities and lives before they were sent to our realm. The Evil Queen and Robin Hood fell in love. Cinderella almost shot her stepsister with a flintlock pistol. Red Riding Hood turned out to also be the wolf and ate her boyfriend right before they almost eloped. Snow White and Prince Charming turned out to be Swan‚Äôs parents.\n\nWhen the characters lived in their own realm, right before The Evil Queen casted the spell and cursed them to our realm, Geppetto build a magical wardrobe that served as a portal for Snow White and Prince Charming to put Swan in (who was a baby at that time). Swan was prophesied to be the saviour who would, on her 27th¬†birthday, break the curse. Geppetto lied and told everyone that the wardrobe can only take one person, although it was bale to send two people to our realm. (They would be sent somewhere else, not to Storybrooke with the rest of the characters, so they would have memory of their lives, but obviously as Emma Swan was just a baby when this happened, she had no memory of her parents or anyone in the magical realm. She was placed in foster care in our realm.) Geppetto sent his son, Pinocchio, with Emma to our realm in the wardrobe and made him promise to take care of her. Pinocchio was just a little boy at that time, and when they arrived in our realm, he broke his promise to take care of her (hence Emma being in foster care). As a result of him breaking his promise, he slowly started to turn back to wood again.\n\nOkay this is all I am going to spoil for you. You have absolutely no idea how happy I was while typing all of this. I was super obsessed with that show at some point.\n\nTHE END\n\n¬†Your watchlist consist of mainly things I recommended ü•∫\n\nYou haven‚Äôt watched Deadpool yet. Not that you need it, but I give you full permission to move Deadpool to the top of your list.\n\nYou composed piano pieces when you were just six years old?! Your parents must have been the proudest parents in the world. *Googles tendinosis, sees the treatment options include ‚Äúrest‚Äù. Orders piano*\n\nNo, seriously it sounds terrible how it affects you now. Having all that talent but being limited and unable to express it to the extend that you know you can. It seems like piano has been such a big part of your life and having to drop all instruments for a year must have been really hard. At that point, did you think that you won‚Äôt really play music anymore or did you know it was just temporarily to take a break from it? So you were originally in a mixed program of electrical engineering / music production and then you had to change majors to focus mainly on electrical engineering? (That is an extremely strange combination indeed\nüòÇ but very interesting as well). I had no idea you started with music at such a young age. This reminds me of the first time I listened to you singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow and when I heard the intro my jaw dropped and I was like ‚Äúno way that is actually him singing!‚Äù üòÖ I don‚Äôt want to sound like I am overhyping or acting more enthusiastic than I actually am, so I just want to ensure you that I really mean it every time that I compliment your music. I would rather just say nothing than saying something that I don‚Äôt mean.\n\nI absolutely, 100% thought you were crippled. I even Googled crutches for hands. (obviously joking, I didn‚Äôt think that at all) üòÇ\n\nThe dogs and tortoise would never roll their eyes at us, we raised them better than that. They would rather verbally abuse us.\n\n(Also, the image of us singing and playing piano together with the dogs and tortoise ü´†)\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶.they all said they each do similar things for their galaxy‚Äôs Karla‚Ä¶‚Äù \n*communicates with every Karla from every galaxy to make sure they sure as hell thank the Alberto of their galaxy for being so kind and make sure they keep the Alberto‚Äôs away from heights*\n\n*sends porcelain dolls to the Karla‚Äôs to send to the Alberto‚Äôs, because apparently that‚Äôs fine*\n\n*prepares trash can to throw fire extinguisher in when inevitable stove fire occurs*",

I ended up focusing on the programming aspect, then I started to sell my code online, this was still a rather niche activity at the time, so there was a market for it. I shifted more and more to other web businesses and after a while I had a *YT: ‚ÄúCat Transcendence -limitless‚Äù* moment where I decided I was Wozniak 2.0 and should just focus on that and switch my major to the mostly-online configuration, but then I went one step further and decided to study ‚ÄùLanguages‚Äù (this was the one I‚Äôd decided would take up the least amount of mental energy), studies which I have never in my life used üòÖ.

It was about pugs, but they were called something else and they were the only dogs able to catch their puppies in the air and this was normal behaviour, also they held their babies up like an otter. They looked like 90% pug, 10% otter. Also, they lived in ponds and at one point in the dream I was standing around in a pond looking for a pug.

Boys (or at least in my groups) ask each other that question ALL of the time, so I‚Äôve thought about it a lot üòÇ I always used to pick:\n\na) Be The Flash: You can save everybody in a small town from a nuke that‚Äôs about 2 seconds away from detonating, you can go back in time, phase through walls, etc. Pretty cool.\nb) Telekinesis: Depending on the debater‚Äôs level of desperation and skill of illustrating an argument just for argument‚Äôs sake, this can become the most ‚Äúoverpowered‚Äù of the lot. Moving things with your mind? You might say. Like, books and stuff? The skilled debater will then pull out the Encyclopedia Galactica and suddenly become a world-renowned physicist with a specialisation in energy, and if you can move energy, you can move anything. \nc) Teleportation: The movie Jumper. We all watched it. Pretty cool.\n\n‚ÄúYou have your fork tightly clasped in your fist and never break eye-contact with him. When I'm not looking, the goose gives you a sadistical look. I pat the goose on his head and says something like, \"You're such a good boy\". Your jaw drops. Your face turns red and smoke comes from your ears.

My head slides up into frame. I have a Maori face tattoo and am wearing a goose costume. ‚ÄúKweeek kweeek, @#$%&‚Äù I say. I have hired the National Geographic crew to film the encounter, but what they capture instead is the goose sneaking out of the bedroom and STEALING from your purse, that‚Äôs right (the purse is in the lounge, I didn‚Äôt let them record the bedroom). He thinks he‚Äôs gonna get away with it too, but what the goose doesn‚Äôt know is that I saw that coming and replaced the bills in your wallet with counterfeits from the kingdom of GooGooGeese that all have individual AirTags from Temu taped on them. The next morning, the King himself, King Goose XXVII, comes by to get the goose. It turns out the blue-ribbon-wearing goose is royalty, but also a kleptomaniac, and they had finally gotten him the help he needed, but he escaped. He returns with his family and gets reformed, they all live happily ever after and I get to sleep in the bed again.  \n\n‚ÄúAlso, I too, believe that this could be a world where all the stars align and life goes our way.‚Äù ü•∫ü•∫ü•π \n\n‚Äú*chuckles nervously with the hope that it's enough to do total damage control*‚Äù üòÇ\n\nYes that IMDB review was glorious! I wonder who wrote that, they need to be rewarded, surely.\n\nI know that, for me, I was hesitant to mention it in case it ‚Äúsnapped you out‚Äù of it, or made you aware of any sort of expected output (which is most definitely not the case! You could write a three-sentence reply and I‚Äôd be happy). \n\n‚ÄúBut of course I want to know how many words we have exchanged!‚Äù Your wish is my command. You were pretty spot-on in your estimation of it being about half a novel, depending on the metric you use for comparison. \n\nWe have exchanged somewhere between 58,866 and 58,230 words (the number has changed since last night, and as I‚Äôm writing this). I‚Äôm gonna go with 58,548. If we account for a completely-made-up rate of quoted messages of 5%, we‚Äôve traded approximately 55,620 words so far. According to the internet, Carrie is between 60,581 and 60,718 words long, I‚Äôm guessing depending on the edition. The ‚Äúaverage‚Äù word count for ‚Äúadult fiction‚Äù, according to Google, ranges from 70,000 to 120,000 words, while for YA novels, the range is 50,000 to 70,000. \n\nHmmmmmmm, that‚Äôs a very good question. I think I would definitely need a few more details than that, but if they had all the music, literature and movies from Earth, unlimited musical instruments, recording studios, nature, cute animals and everyone I care about could join me, I would definitely put it up for a vote. I would love to see what living in another planet is like. What about you, would you volunteer?\n\nI only watched (a lot of) bits of Smallville, but never a whole season beginning to end. Somebody SAAAAAAVE MEEEEEE *runs at super-speed, trips on pebble, breaks toe*. \n\nThat list made me happy for 3 reasons:\n\n1. I am watching Deadpool this week.\n2. I taught you what ‚Äúbreaking the fourth wall‚Äù mean (and I‚Äôm only slightly disappointed you didn‚Äôt break it, amirite y‚Äôall?!).\n3. You‚Äôre cute.\n\n‚ÄúAnd yes! We will absolutely read chapter 2 this weekend *excitedly kicks legs like a puppy having a nightmare*‚Äù ü•π Yessssssss *victory jump*.\n\nTom & Jerry music to me is Tom playing Liszt üòÇ. \n*Listens to \"Cheek to cheek\", goes ü´†.

And that is basically the whole personality of the show, so I'm kind of confused by what I actually remembered about it. Just that it existed? üòÖ\nI have to say, I don't think I have ever watched Jimmy Neutron, but I blindly agree with everything you said about the sequel. Also, Jimmy's hair looks like a KFC soft serve, but brown. \n\n\"There was definitely foliage\" üòÇ I wouldn't have suspected otherwise. By the way, don't you just love the smell of earth after rain? And freshly cut grass? Also, important question- do you like cinnamom? Both smell and taste. \n\nI think that's great because the chances that I heard it before are very low, so although I might need to Google your references, I think that's part of the reason I find them so darn funny. To me it's all new. \nOh wow you weren't kidding when you said you haven't watched much TV lately üòÖ\nSpeaking of new stuff, apparently there's a show or cartoon or whatever (I don't even want to Google it, too disappointed) called TV Boy or TV Head or something, not sure, (yet again, I refuse to Google it) about a boy with a TV head. And from the description of the show and all the slang and phrases that came from it, I have lost like 80% faith in humanity. As I got older I finally started to understand why our parents always complained about how much things have changed and how our music/movies suck to them. I don't think everything today sucks though, but I fully understand the struggle to adapt to something so completely different from what you grew up with. I am therefore not the biggest advocate for the era we live in. \n(The Darwin quote \"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change,\" comes to mind and I realize I am fine with going extinct üòÇ)\nAlso, my answer to the volunteering to live on another planet might have just now in this specific moment changed for all the above reasons. I used to think that I would easily volunteer for something like that. It would be new and exciting and you'd get to experience something a very high statistic of humans never will. \nBut I think it would take an extremely long time for it to start feeling like home, and I would just be in a constant longing for Earth. My mind would eventually start telling me that the war and crime and everything negative here were not actually that bad and I would probably struggle to connect to the new planet. Also, I can see how that can be psychoanalysed in a certain way, and I can with absolute certainty say that it is not connected to anything else. \n\nI like how you chose The Flash to save everybody. So selfless of you. You really put a lot of thought into the telekinesis one. The part where you said \"and if you can move energy, you can move anything\" gave me power hungry villian vibes üòÇ also just joking. I highly doubt that you are able to be a villian. Also, all of this made me think of Megamind for some reason. And now I'm thinking of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. And now I will shut up. \nOh wait, I have one last thing to add. When you said that boys usually ask that question to each other a lot, I tried to think of a question that usually repeats in female conversations and realized that it's almost always, \"If you were a single mother and couldn't find a job and had no family or friends and had to fend for your baby, would you become a stripper?\" üòÇ\n\n\"üò≠ that's brutal\" I take it back!!! I didn't mean it! I was just tired. I was on drugs. I was drunk. I was hypnotised. I was gun-pointed. I took an oath. I was possessed. The porcelain doll stared at me. I was out of coffee. The dog ate my homework. \n*mental image of me sneaking out of the room, leaving the duck alone in bed, and slipping under the blanket next to you on the couch*\n\n*starts reading your story* \nThe image of your Maori tattooed face sliding up into frame üòÇüòÇ I would have never thought of anything like that if you hadn't mentioned it. Probably ever. \n\"Kweeek kweeek, @#$%&\" üòÇ\nHow could the goose have betrayed me like that? üò¢\nAlso a very smart move of you for not letting them record the bedroom. I also appreciate the reappearance of the Temu AirTags. I am happy the goose got the help he needed, I wish him the best. There was a period in my life where I sincerely thought the goose and I had a connection, but I guess it's typical goose behaviour to dissapoint. No hard feelings. I'm just glad we are back in the same bed again, say what you want but geese are not the best cuddlers. So, forgive and forget? \n\n\"You could write a three-sentence reply and I'd be happy\" ü•∫\nOh my gosh we really could have written half a darn novel! In less than a month! Why aren't we best-selling authors yet? Procrastination for me. And you are already a prodigy so oh what the hell. \n\nOkay, so let's say hypothetically that no, they didn't have any literature or musical instruments or anything like that from Earth and you would be going with an X amount of strangers. It is purely for the experience of living on another planet, forever. But the planet has lots of foliage and other types of cute animal species.

I just remember my brother and his friends watching it and I would occasionally pop in and watch a part of it with them and then leave to play Chicken Invaders on the PC üòÇ but I never left during the theme song.

My dream last night: \nI dreamt about a litter of puppies, but there was 1 puppy who was significantly smaller than the rest and got rejected by his mother, and the siblings never played with him. He was severely depressed so I took care of him. Every time I put him down, the mom would bite him. That was very sad. And in the same dream there was a part where my dad wanted to buy apples (remember how I mentioned that you mentioned Granny Smith apples?) but the guy we usually bought them from wasn't there. The next morning there were 2 gigantic bags of green apples on the car seats but no one knew where they came from. Then I thought the guy came to deliver the apples and took our puppies as a trade. That was even more sad, but then I saw the puppies playing somewhere and I felt better. \n\nI had another dream in which I had a horse. I just remember gently cleaning her hooves and washing her.",

    "text": "Yes, I grew up in Vietnam, my real name is Ph√∫ Qu√¥c. I was trained from a young age in the art of pottery by a travelling merchant . He was famous by name when he was young, but nobody believed he was who he said now, so one day he told me to put on a fake beard and he acted like I was him and that he recognised me, and somehow people believed him, so we started selling our vases. Eventually people wanted more vases than we could make, so we started smuggling knockoff of our own designs. One day, the po-po came a knockin‚Äô and the merchant and me had to evade them in an epic motorbike chase. There were two small boats waiting for us in the water on the pier, and coincidentally there was a lady selling fruit with two ramps that lined up perfectly with the boats, so we each looked at each other one last time and jumped off the ramps, letting our Vespas drop into the water. The people on the boat took me in as their own and named me Alberto. Hmmmm, that's a great point. I've been told a story that I think is greatly exaggerated, but if one is to believe the tale, one day when I was just chilling in the womb üë∂ I was restless and they played Beethoven and I calmed down, and apparently when Beethoven stopped I would start kicking again. Like I said, I don't know that it's true. That said, Beethoven has always been my favourite and I was only told the story when I was grown. My mother is much more of a Rachmaninoff man than the mighty Ludwig Van, and my father was more of a Bach and Mozart type of guy. For me, it's always been Beethoven.\n\n*pulls out Bingo card* üòÇ. That‚Äôs really cool! Does that mean you like the visual arts? Do you have a favourite painter or favourite paintings? Mine are the most clich√©: Vermeer(very close second place tied between Rembrandt and Hopper) and \"Het melksmeisje\" respectively. \n\nOh I didn‚Äôt finish all of that, I kept switching. Languages was just the most ‚Äúhands-free‚Äù one üòÖ that allowed me to work on other things at the same time. \n\n‚ÄúI studied Financial Management‚Äù üèÜ. Ok, you don‚Äôt know how nice it is to hear that. Not that you studied that specifically, but just that you have a financial education (a massive understatement in this case). Obviously not to the same extent, but I‚Äôve been mildly interested in finance from a distance ever since I was like thirteen when I was at the supermarket and thought to ask some random question when reading some food packaging, it went something like:\n‚Äúwhy does this Sam‚Äôs Club packaging say Walmart Group?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWalmart owns Sam‚Äôs‚Äù\n‚ÄúWho owns Walmart?\"\n‚ÄúThe shareholders‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a sha-‚Äù\n*Camera cuts to reading ‚Äúfinance for dummies‚Äù* üòÇ.\nI loved learning about things like that. My parents were adamant about me keeping track of my own expenses since I was a toddler, so finding out there was a world out there where this was normalised was cool üòÇ.\n\nStory time: When I was six I was at the candy store and saw they had boxes of the chocolate bars that each went for 10 Simoleons at the cinema, and for some reason you never saw them being sold elsewhere. I pulled out my abacus and realised each chocolate bar came out to about 2.50 Simoleons for me (that‚Äôs how I discovered arbitrage). Every kid I knew loved those chocolates, so I put down all my savings (the kindergarten I went to had a little shop where you could buy lunch, but I brought my own lunch from home so I just saved my allowance in my piggy bank) and ran a Series A round and bought a box of chocolates, I sold them for a little under the 10 Simoleons, like 9 (what a deal! they thought) and if you bought two they were like 7 *capitalism intensifies*. I was, of course, eventually caught and asked to stop, I was like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre punishing me for doing what you‚Äôre training us to do. YOU CAN‚ÄôT HANDLE THE TRUTH!‚Äù. So that‚Äôs how I got into the habit of reinvesting üòÇ. I don‚Äôt like the idea of working in Finance much though, I used to have a friend who became a broker and he pretty much never slept. Good on you for listening to you and doing something about it, most people don‚Äôt. \n\nBtw, I‚Äôm really glad to hear that you didn‚Äôt arrive in Thailand alone and that you learned the ropes from a pro. \n\n‚ÄúDecisions, decisions.‚Äù üòÇ. What other subjects interest you enough to study them? Spare no detail! Or I will imagine you as a pro-wrestling entomologist. Could I ask, in the case of going back to school, have you thought about where? Why do I ask? Pfff no reason, what are you even talking about *closes spreadsheet, takes off cap from Hades, gets up and puts on winged sandals, looks at NDT drinking Kombucha and unboxing his new Kindle device at the dinner table*.\n\n‚Äúenjoyed doing citations in school üòÇ not a lot, just a little bit more than the average person‚Äù you need not hide your love of citations. You are talking to somebody who knows about the existence of Bookends (citation software). ‚ÄúSo just the right amount to make people have the pepper spray ready when they pass me in the street*‚Äù üòÇ.\n\nWhen you put it like that, I guess it would be pretty unnerving to see Bugs Bunny walking around in ‚Äùreal life‚Äù. That is beyond cute that you didn‚Äôt know that, even I know LSD is a square-looking thing, and I‚Äôve never done drugs (as previously stated) but now just knowing that I knew made me feel like I‚Äôve been smoking crack my whole life. Wait, is it actually a square-looking thing or a pill? *realises pills are not all one shape. Googles it* wait, what? *scrolls* Oh ok, some pictures show the square-looking thing, others a pill. \n\nOk, first of all, who names a movie about football/soccer-playing doggos ‚ÄúAir Buddies‚Äù? That sounds like basketball, volleyball, polo, snowboarding, skiing‚Ä¶ every other sport except üêïüêï‚öΩÔ∏è pawball. Also, I‚Äôm finding it surprisingly hard to imagine a dog dribbling a ball with their paw across the field, it‚Äôs almost impawssible.\n\nü•∫ü•π\n\nI forgot to mention earlier how extremely happy I was to receive your 2 billion hugs, I‚Äôm still mega-melting from that.",

    "text": "(When I woke up from my power nap after work, I was kind of sad to not see you next to me in bed ü•≤ I think I might have overdone the whole 'convincing myself that you are the pillow' thing. So for a second, through the slumber confusion, I searched for you. I decided that I was being silly and relistened to your voice note from this morning for comfort instead.)\n\nüòÇüòÇAh I heard about those women in Vietnam only selling fruit near ramps that align perfectly with boats. They call themselves the Deus Ex Machina, which I think is a little dramatic, but I guess to each their own. \nI imagined that scene where you guys took the ramps, to be the part in a movie where the video would pause as you guys are mid-air and something like \"Thunderstruck\" would play and the names of the characters would appear next to them with some funny nickname in quotations under it. Your name will definitely have something to do with \"Pug\" and your friend something like \"Vanilla Ice\" (as they both were famous once upon a time and then completely forgotten as time passed).\n\n\n\"...one day when I was just chilling in the womb üë∂\" üòÖ\nI completely believe that story happened exactly just like that, and it's so darn cute knowing a part of your personality even as an unborn baby ü•∫ It made me want to listen to Beethoven so I went and listened to \"Ode an die Freude\" and \"F√ºr Elise\" and for some reason I got a recommended video about nine of the cruelest punishments in history and it is not even close to anything I have ever clicked or will ever click on, so I don't know what that was about. I think Beethoven might have had a dark side and the algorithm knew about it. \nBut the point is, Beethoven's piano pieces are absolutely beautiful. \n(I was extremely reluctant to bring this up, so I am really sorry if I rather shouldn't have, but you speak about your dad in the past tense?)\n\nI'm pretty versatile when it comes to visual arts and can appreciate anything that evokes an emotion. I won't really say I have a favourite painter, but I like the way the ocean has a whole personality in Ivan Aivazovsky's paintings (it might be due to my dad's influence, but I kind of like boats and airplanes, probably one of the only reasons I watched Pearl Harbour as a kid. After watching that movie, Faith Hill's \"There You'll Be\" might have made me cry more than I would like to admit. But I am happy to report that I have completely healed from that and can now listen to that song with slight apathy) I'm not a super fan of bright colours in paintings, I tend to lean more towards darker shades, but this is where I sound like a hypocrite because I also like retro art. Yes! Vermeer's paintings are also great! Rembrandt's colour palette is exactly what I referred to when I mentioned darker shades. Is there a specific meaning behind the \"Het melksmeisje\" painting that makes you like it? Or is it the aesthetic? (I could Google the meaning of the painting, but I prefer to hear it from you) \n\nYou had an interest in finance at thirteen?! That is very INTJ of you üòÇ also so adorable how curious you were and still are. I don't think there was ever a point in my life where I was interested in finance. When we were introduced to accounting during our first year of highschool, I used to absolutely hate it, but ironically it became the subject I was best at. Same with Geography. Hated it, excelled at it. What can I say? The way to my heart is through hate üòÇ (this is 100% completely a joke). \n\n\nWait, hold up, you were really six years old when you figured all of that out? *cough cough* PRODIGY! *cough cough* I am really impressed, but I also can't help to imagine six-year old Alberto yelling at a kid to get off the tire swing as it's your usual spot where you sit and balance your accounts. I picture you with glasses and a dinosaur stuffed toy under your arm as you calculate your parents' taxes on your abacus (*Major Young Sheldon Vibes*ü´°)\nNow I also imagine you constantly correcting your kindergarten teacher using your inside voice and a lot of fruit-themed profanities, because even though you were supposed to be in the fifth grade already, you were also somewhat polite. I might have mixed a little too much of Sheldon's personality in there. \nAlso, \"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!\" üòÇüòÇ\n\nNo I would never have moved here if my brother wasn't here already. The language barrier alone might have been reason enough not to come. \n\n\"Spare no detail!\" you will so regret this. \nI kind of like the idea of a pro-wrestling entomologist, or at least you imagining me as one. Minus the wrestling part. But keep the \"pro\" part. \nI wanted to study psychology at some point but you need to go all the way to doctorate level, which is not a problem, the problem is how limited you are with acceptable programs and routes. For example, in South Africa, to get registered with The Health Professions Council of South Africa, you need to have studied at one of the listed universities and have done your internship during your final year of the masters program at one of the listed institutions. So this kind of goes against the whole 'not being in South Africa' part of the scenario. During the 3 years masters you are also not allowed to work, at all. Not even part-time. And I heard a lot of stories about already qualified and registered psychologists trying to get a job abroad, for example in Australia, but can't get accepted because they don't count the internship year as part of \"a studying year\" (insane, I know). But I also heard about a \"loophole\" of starting a practice but registering it as a \"coaching\" company or something similar. \nI actually would have studied science with a major in biotechnology, but then I moved to a different city after finishing highschool. When I was younger I always saw myself getting into publishing (hence the Margaret Tate reference that one time) but I guess it's not the best financial decision. So the interests are all over the place, cue indecisiveness. But something that's not really negotiable for me is: I always had this internal need to write a book before I pass away one day, so whichever career I end up in, can not by any means take up every single second of my life (as with finance). And I also kind of promised my language teacher that I would, and she passed away, so I feel obligated (only slightly joking about the feeling obligated part).\nRegarding where I want to study: It would have to be at a uni that's internationally recognised and also allows me to work while studying, so I kind of had studying online through The University of South Africa in mind, but it's not limited to that. There would be a lot of other options, depending on the situation. \n(I love that you asked that question by the way)\n\"*closes spreadsheet, takes off cap from Hades, gets up and puts on winged sandals, looks at NDT drinking Kombucha and unboxing his new Kindle device at the dinner table*\" üòÇ I like how the NDT is always at the dinner table. \n\nAahh how romantic to find someone who is not completely appalled by citations. The beauty of the 21st century. \n*stares at envelopes and pen and paper on table and has the romantic urge to throw the phone out the window*\n\n\"but now just knowing that I knew made me feel like I've been smoking crack my whole life\" üòÇ after Googling LSD, I can only imagine the type of recommended content you'll be receiving. \"Feeling like life has kicked you in your crack-addicted stomach? Call this number for counseling *insert my number after I turned 36 and am finally qualified to be a psychologist*\"\n\nOkay I have once again Googled it, and now Air Buddies looks like the dogs are playing basketball and baseball and everything, not just soccer. Why are you doing this to me Google, why? So I guess Air Buddies includes a variety of sport. \n\"impawssible\" ü•∫\n\nYou reminded me of the 2 billion hugs and now I need a moment to just picture that.\n*pictures it* ü´†ü´†ü´†\nThat was absolutely lovely, thank you.\n\n(So sorry, the reply on your second text will come soon!)",

So for a second, through the slumber confusion, I searched for you. I decided that I was being silly and relistened to your voice note from this morning for comfort instead.)‚Äù  I have re-read this a bunch of times and it gives me butterflies every time. A while after waking up from my nap earlier I realised I was caressing the corner of my pillow like it was your hair, I felt the wall roll its eyes at me, but I continued.\n\n\n\nI‚Äôve always like the phrase ‚ÄúDeus Ex Machina‚Äù. Btw, have you seen that movie ‚ÄúEx Machina‚Äù? It‚Äôs soooo good. You don‚Äôt know how often I have that type of character intro in my head üòÇ, it‚Äôs probably as often as once a month. They look like you describe too, for me I imagine it like *YT: Scooter Character Intro [Borderlands 2]*. I can picture mine vividly: Alberto\n\n‚ÄúGet Pug‚Äôd!‚Äù.\n\nPoor Vanilla Ice, always name-dropped  just to get dunked on.\n\n\n\nI‚Äôm guessing the recommendation might be because of the number nine in the title. ‚ÄúOde a die Freude‚Äù is the first movement of the 9th.  The second (Molto Vivace) movement of the 9th symphony is my favourite piece of music ever. There was a version on YouTube where to me it sounded slightly faster than normal and more frantic, I can‚Äôt seem to find it right now, but that version is *chef‚Äôs kiss*, perfection. \n\n\n\nPlease don‚Äôt be reluctant to ask me things! It‚Äôs totally ok, I never want you to feel uncomfortable about asking me anything. But yes, my father is deceased. It‚Äôs been a few years. Thank you for asking.\n\n\n\nI looked up Avazovsky (I‚Äôm not much for pretending I know the names of painters), wow. Those are SO beautiful. I think I only knew the first one that pops up, ‚ÄúThe Shipwreck at the Tempest‚Äù because the title sounds familiar. I love paintings of the water! Even when it looks completely different, like in ‚ÄúPool With Two Figures‚Äù üòÖ.\n\n\n\nI have to admit, I don‚Äôt much remember the movie Pearl Harbor, but I looked up the music video for ‚ÄúThere You‚Äôll Be‚Äù and I had to stop watching the video very quickly, too sad. I‚Äôm glad you are able to listen to the song with ‚Äúslight apathy‚Äù now üòÇ.  The reason I like ‚ÄúHet Melksmeisje‚Äù so much is that something about it feels so real to me. The way it‚Äôs framed, my eyes fall on the milkmaid‚Äôs hat first, but because the milk jug is in my periphery, I‚Äôm already hearing it. By the time my eyes focus on the milk, the bread on the table has entered my periphery and those two in sequence probably trigger my olfactory memory, and the place in the scene looks very homely too. I‚Äôve never seen the original in person, but I can easily picture the place as if I‚Äôd been there. I don‚Äôt know what  ‚Äúthe critics‚Äù say about it, I‚Äôve never much cared for that sort of thing. I also don‚Äôt know the story behind the painting üòÖ. \n\n\n\nI‚Äôm surprised you hated geography, why? üòÇ I always thought it was a very chill class. I would say it wasn‚Äôt very entertaining, but that makes me feel bad for geography, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs trying her best. \n\n\n\nI think the prodigy nickname was more of a meme, please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm legitimately Sheldon Cooper Lite Edition üòÇ *Guy in my head: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt your family use to call you Sheldon when that show was airing? Me: Sshhh, that‚Äôs not the point!*. Ok, who told you about the tyre swings?! *peeks through blindfolds briefly*. Wait, did you have a stuffed dinosaur when you were little? ü•π.",

Is it 100% Google Translate? I know Thailand is famously a haven for Digital Nomads too so I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs a lot of stuff in English as well, but I don‚Äôt know.\n\n‚ÄúI kind of like the idea of a pro-wrestling entomologist, or at least you imagining me as one. Minus the wrestling part. But keep the \"pro\" part‚Äù üòÇ Ahhh, I was already picturing you wrestling in a Flying Squirrel onesie that grants you the power to glide through the air.\n\nI don‚Äôt regret asking at all, I‚Äôm actually even more curious now üòÖ. Ohhh wow, those are some very specific regulations, especially with the no-jobs policy.  Three-year master‚Äôs was also unexpected.

I‚Äôm not sure if the rules change per area of study, but I would hope at least some do offer that for most majors. There‚Äôs also co-op programs in some places, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs also other options, like you said. I‚Äôm glad the question didn‚Äôt freak you out, by now, I think you probably already even expected it üòÖ. Oh yes, NDT is always at the dinner table. I had also been reading about the new Kindle lineup yesterday, it made sense that he‚Äôd be getting a new one too, I don‚Äôt know where the kombucha came from though üòÇ.\n\nI have the urge to throw my phone out the window all the time! (Well, not lately). I‚Äôm just waiting for someone to come out with a decent e-ink phone so that I can pretend it‚Äôs some Harry Potter version of a phone with magic paper like an issue of the Daily Prophet.\n\n\"Feeling like life has kicked you in your crack-addicted stomach?‚Äù üòÇüòÇ. *Calls your number a million times, phone company thinks it‚Äôs some sort of attack on their network*.\n\nThat was absolutely lovely, thank you.\n\n*Me, ready to give you a septillion hugs now: ‚ÄúAnytime :)‚Äù\n\nReally?! Thank you , I worked really hard on that one. \nThat‚Äôs such a huge coincidence because I‚Äôve been thinking about sending fan mail for the first time too.  You remembered I like bamboo shoots ü•π. \n\n*Reads ‚ÄúIn my mind it will always be you‚Äù out of context again, ü´†*. Ok, understood, I will try not to cite my quotes (this might be difficult). I think shooting music videos outside has to be the most awkward experience, anytime I watch one I just imagine them lip-syncing in silence while their shoes squeak and trucks honk in the background.\n\n‚ÄúDoes this mean the image in your mind when we mention our dogs, are usually pugs for you? (because that is totally okay with me obviously) I am double checking because it's vital that we imagine the same dogs. I think we need to have a discussion on what our dogs look like by the way. ‚Äù ü•∫ü•∫ü´† *Walter Mitty*. For some reason, I always picture Labrador dogs as our dogs, HOWEVER, please read next paragraph.\n\nOk, so I‚Äôve lived with small dogs, medium dogs and large dogs. Any type of dog is a good dog, but unfortunately, sometimes the bark of large dogs tends to kind of hurt my ears when it‚Äôs right next to me (I have sensitive ears, this is not the flex that it sounds like üòÖ). So I think a more quiet dog would be ideal (I know, almost impawssible), I‚Äôm not sure which are the most relaxed or have a lower volume. We had a Chihuahua growing up named Canelo , that guy barked non-stop üòÇ. \n\n(My music streaming app just started playing Only Wanna Be With You, this is very important. Also, what a coincidence that the guy in the song loves Bob Dylan and the song was in Marley & Me.)\n\nWhat do our dogs look like to you? (I love saying that ü•π).\n\nI watched the stand-up bit that comes up when I searched for ‚Äúpug comedy bit‚Äù where the guy says pugs aren‚Äôt dogs, and says they have cow eyes üòÖ. \n\nI am already looking at Otter onesies online, they‚Äôre too cute üòÇ.\n\n*Frowns, but secretly really wants you to use that knowledge against him.*\n\n‚ÄúMe: Pulls out the water extractor‚Äù üòÇ.\n\nü•πüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®ü´†ü¶¶‚ù§Ô∏èü¶≠\n\nOhh ok, I thought I was ‚Äútripping‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúSomething just moved inside my chest I swear.‚Äù ü•∫ this made me feel like something was pressed against my chest, like the world‚Äôs heaviest pillow (in a very good way).\n\n‚ÄúThis made me feel so many overwhelming things all at once.

I am glad you didn't stop. I would have held a grudge against that wall. \n\nI have never seen that movie, but it looks interesting, and Rotten Tomatoes seems to approve (which means nothing). I think I might have seen the cover of it before though and considered watching it, but just didn't get to it. \n\"You don't know how often I have that type of character intro in my head üòÇ, it's probably as often as once a month.\" üòÇ\nIt feels like I should do a monthly check-up on that from now on üòÇ\n\nI watched the Borderlands 2 video and damn that guy sounds a little country. \n\"Get Pug'd!\" üòÇ\nI can completely see that it aligns with your sense of humour and personality from what I've seen so far.\n\nAh!

Water paintings are beautiful.  \nI Googled the meaning behind Pool With Two Figures and I would have never guessed the meaning behind it. \n\"It tells the story of a tragic breakup: Christie‚Äôs describes it as 'a vivid testament to a once-in-a-lifetime love.'‚Äù \n\nOh, I'm sorry!

I don't even want to Google the meaning behind it, I prefer to see it the way you described.\nI think it was just a little boring learning about different types of sand üòÇ There were obviously interesting topics as well, but I think compared to the other subjects, it was a little more boring. Maybe the class setup had something to do with it. I remember that no one paid attention in that class and it was always noisy and the kids threw papers and erasers and such around in class, and the teacher was always yelling at someone. Maybe that played a huge role in me not liking it either. \n\"but that makes me feel bad for geography, I'm sure she's trying her best.\" ü•∫ From now on I will be nice to her. I will compliment her erosion and everything. She deserves better. I'm sorry. \n\nIf you say that you are not Sheldon Cooper Lite Edition, then I will choose to believe you üòÖ\nYour family calling you Sheldon doesn't do much to prove your point though üòÇ, but I will think of all the sweet messages you have sent thus far to convince me you're not üòÖ (I'm just joking, there's no way you are anything like Sheldon. And if you slightly are, I'll probably find it cute, and if not, I'll have my stapler ready) \n\nI don't think I had one, but I might be completely wrong as well. *trying to think of all the stuffed toys I had, remembers the Teletubbies one even though I never really watched it* Nope, I'm almost sure I didn't have a dinosaur one. Did you have a stuffed dinosaur as a kid? ü•∫\n\nI'd say where I live now (Nakhon Pathom, +- 1h away from Bangkok), it's maybe 90% Google translate. Places like Bangkok and Chiang Mai with more foreigners typically don't have such a big problem with communication. But you kind of have to learn their language a little if you live in smaller areas. \"Thailand is famously a haven for Digital Nomads..\" I never really understood the hype to be honest üòÖ (I'm not denigrating Thailand by the way, it's great in a lot of ways)\n\nMe? A flying squirrel? Yes please! Having a suit that enables me to glide through the air? Yes please! \nWill I glide with the flying squirrel babies and try to convince them that I am their mother? Probably. Will their actual mothers be sad about it? Probably. Is that reason enough for me to not actually do it? Probably. Am I sad about it? Yes. Do I deserve to glide with flying squirrels? Yes. Am I convinced that if I say the word \"flying squirrels\" enough that I will dream about them tonight? Absolutely. \n\n\"*Deletes the part where you said 'before I pass away one day*\" ü´† Thank you, I feel like 60 more years have been added to my life.

It was only the masters for psych at Unisa that doesn't allow it, which was strange because it's not really the norm. \n\nOh there's a new Kindle coming out? I see the first ever colour Kindle has been released, you want to tell me that Kindle users have been reading books in black and white all this time? (*Imagines a world where adult novels have pictures on every page so that the above drama is relevant*)\nIt's so kind of you for including the NDT in the new Kindle lineup. You are even sweet to imaginary objects. See - not like Sheldon Cooper at all! The kombucha gave the NDT personality. I will now forever imagine the NDT as someone who daydreams about buying a boat and retiring in Hawaii. \n(Also, I am pretty sure I know what NDT is, but I feel like we just need to confirm that we are on the same page here. What is NDT to you?)\n\nI will 100% share in your imagination with the Harry Potter e-ink phone. I like how we can probably talk about paperclips and still connect it to Harry Potter in some way. Speaking about the Daily Prophet, are you: \nA) sad\nB) not affected because you are a psychopath\nC) happy\nabout the fact that newspapers are not so popular anymore and that print journalism are basically going extinct? \nOf course I remembered you like bamboo shoots! (*looks at the message of you listing your favourite foods that she has taken a screenshot of*)\n\n\n\"*Reads 'In my mind it will always be you' out of context again, ü´†*.\"\n*Thinks that maybe she intended to phrase it like that for exactly this reason*\n\nNooo you don't have to try to not cite your quotes! üòÖ you can do whatever you want to do! I don't mind either way! You can cite the orgin of every single word in every single sentence you sent for all that I care. I just meant that you don't HAVE to, I won't think anything negative of it. But it's completely up to you. (Probably the longest conversation I ever had regarding \"to cite or not to cite\", Shakespeare, W. (1603) Hamlet. Act 3, Scene 1.)\n\nOkay, to be completely honest, initially I also imagined Labradors, really really. But then I thought that in movies it's usually Labradors or Golden Retrievers so I'll try to switch it up a bit. Hence the Border Collies. \"Ok, so I've lived with small dogs, medium dogs and large dogs. Any type of dog is a good dog,\" üòÇ so poetic. \n\n*Gets bingo card* \nI've also lived with all sizes of dogs and can fully agree that the barking is a problem for me as well. I, too, don't like loud noises so that was definitely a flex in my opinion üòÇ \nHow do you feel about trading the imaginary dogs for imaginary cats? Or would our imagination not like that?

    "text": "I was re-reading your previous messages and melting this morning when I noticed I forgot to reply to part of a message from a few days ago so I‚Äôll be replying to that first:\n\n‚ÄúAs I got older I finally started to understand why our parents always complained about how much things have changed and how our music/movies suck to them. I don't think everything today sucks though, but I fully understand the struggle to adapt to something so completely different from what you grew up with. I am therefore not the biggest advocate for the era we live in.‚Äù Yup, I totally agree üë¥. \n\n‚ÄúI used to think that I would easily volunteer for something like that. It would be new and exciting and you'd get to experience something a very high statistic of humans never will.‚Äù That used to be my opinion too. There‚Äôs a videogame I played a long time ago called Mass Effect where you can travel to other planets and at the time I thought that if I could, I‚Äôd go and do that in a picosecond. But then I realised I‚Äôd probably go bananas without the arts and familiar nature and animals. Is Earth really so bad when we have harbour seals here? I think not. If I did go, I‚Äôd probably end up drawing a smiley face on my Kindle and calling it ‚ÄúWilson‚Äù like in Castaway. ‚ÄúAlso, I can see how that can be psychoanalysed in a certain way, and I can with absolute certainty say that it is not connected to anything else.‚Äù This was very comforting. I want to state for the record that I can say with absolute certainty that my thoughts on this also are not in any way to be related to that psychoanalytic interpretation.\n\n‚ÄúAlso, all of this made me think of Megamind for some reason.‚Äù I love Megamind! I‚Äôve only seen it once but I remember enjoying it quite a lot. This may or may not have taken place just a few years ago.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you said that boys usually ask that question to each other a lot, I tried to think of a question that usually repeats in female conversations and realized that it's almost always, \"If you were a single mother and couldn't find a job and had no family or friends and had to fend for your baby, would you become a stripper?\" üòÇ‚Äù My face learning that this is something girls ask each other: üßê. Just kidding üòÇ.\n\n‚ÄúI take it back!!! I didn't mean it! I was just tired. I was on drugs. I was drunk. I was hypnotised. I was gun-pointed. I took an oath. I was possessed. The porcelain doll stared at me. I was out of coffee. The dog ate my homework.‚Äù üòÇüòÇ.\n\n‚Äú*mental image of me sneaking out of the room, leaving the duck alone in bed, and slipping under the blanket next to you on the couch*‚Äù ü´†ü´†.\n\n‚ÄúOh my gosh we really could have written half a darn novel! In less than a month! Why aren't we best-selling authors yet? Procrastination for me.‚Äù This reminds me I‚Äôm doing the annual 50K-word ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù in November! There used to be this thing called Nanowrimo that was mostly not something that authors actually cared about, but it was good to get hobbyists to push themselves to try and finish a rough first draft of a novel in a month. There had been controversies surrounding them before and their reputation (rightfully) took a dive in recent years, but recently they decided to complete their societal seppuku by praising AI and saying everyone who doesn‚Äôt love it is a fascist (I‚Äôm paraphrasing). Of course, nobody liked that. Now virtually everyone that was interested in the event has formed or migrated to writing groups just to keep the spirit going. I have absolutely no idea why I‚Äôm sharing this. \n\n‚Äúleave to play Chicken Invaders on the PC üòÇ‚Äù for some reason I found that very funny, I don‚Äôt even know the game *looks up Chicken Invaders* oohhhhh it‚Äôs Space Invaders, but with chickens! I played some Space Invaders a few months ago! I‚Äôm still not very good at it.\n\n‚Äú*Gently puts a Despicable Me plaster on your toe. (kindly note these plasters have the ability to even do an organ transplant)‚Äù ü•π\n\n‚Äú*sees the words ‚ÄòI‚Äôm slightly dissapointed.‚Äô Heart ‚Äòslightly‚Äô shatters. Puts Despicable Me plaster on self*‚Äù ü•∫ noooo, I take it back! I didn‚Äôt mean it! I was huffing glue. I was taking candy from babies. I was vandalising Ikea. I was‚Ä¶ wait, wrong format. The point is, I‚Äôm sorry *pulls out a bouquet of comically big roses that fell from the sky, but thanks to my great reflexes, never touched the ground. The bouquet is so big I‚Äôm having to hold it in a hug*. \n\nThe episodes with the dog in Tom & Jerry were indeed the best üòÇ.\n\nThe story about you and your dad finding 2 gigantic bags of  Granny Smith apples and then the guy taking the puppies is so sad ü•∫. I was relieved to then immediately read that you saw the puppies playing somewhere after that.\n\nDo you like horses? Have you ever ridden a horse? I have, but only a couple of times. My aunt and her family were into competition, I think. I never liked it much, I kept thinking the horse might suddenly decide he‚Äôs tired of humans and throw me off. I liked it even less after one time I stood near a tree and there was a lot of wind and I guess it rattled a wasp nest and they must‚Äôve thought I‚Äôd done it. Oh how I ran, I ran like the roadrunner on Red Bull that day, but they still got me, twelve of them. I think it was twelve. That was enough of the stables for me.\n\n‚Äú*sees app logo in notifications panel, has zero regard for anything else, puts fork in toaster, toaster catches fire, her hair catches fire, she remains stationary and looks at messages with googly eyes while everything burns to the ground*‚Äù ü•πü´† \n*Runs through wall like the Kool-Aid Man while holding a hose tethered to a fire truck, resists the urge to say ‚ÄúOH YEAH!‚Äù, unplugs toaster, adjusts the water flow to ‚Äúhair & toaster‚Äù, water comes out, now you are safe. Wraps blanket around you, puts Despicable Me plaster on your head, seals it with a kiss that feels like five seconds but is actually five minutes long, the plaster slides off your head and then your hair magically starts growing back, hugs you tightly, gets poked in the eye by still-growing hair but doesn‚Äôt care, asks you to go put on dry clothes so you don‚Äôt catch a cold, rebuilds wall he ran through.*\n\nI‚Äôm already halfway through writing my next message so that'll be coming soon!",

But then I thought ‚Äúwait a minute‚Äù, and I opened my browser again and the page with my track upload said ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù, so apparently they started re-processing my track all over again. I just hit cancel. I searched for ‚ÄúPhlebas‚Äù on Spotify (the ‚ÄúArtist name‚Äù I‚Äôd chosen), and nothing pops up, so I think they‚Äôve deleted it. I didn‚Äôt even like the name Phlebas anyway *sobs*. No, I actually don‚Äôt much like the sound of it üòÖ.

I‚Äôll be re-uploading tomorrow, but this time I‚Äôll be choosing a name I like more, hopefully (the name Phlebas comes from a poem. I found the poem by looking up a novel I haven‚Äôt read yet, titled ‚ÄúConsider Phlebas‚Äù, I was curious what the name meant üòÖ it‚Äôs actually pretty cool, so I‚Äôd just gone with that because every name under the sun seems to be taken.

I thought of going with ‚ÄúMelbrook‚Äù because in the Superpowereds books our heroes live in ‚ÄúMelbrook Hall‚Äù, but then I googled ‚ÄúMelbrook‚Äù and I get Mel Brooks üòÇüòÇ.

It blows my mind how we‚Äôre so close to having those ‚ÄúUniversal Translator‚Äù gadgets from  Sci-Fi in real life üòÇ. Also, this new information may or may not require some recalibrations to my spreadsheet.\n\nSo did you dream about the flying squirrels? (I know, I know, I still have to ask).  \n\nDid I just spend the last few minutes looking up pictures of squirrels? Yes, no, maybe.\n\n*Ignores the part that makes him think of a world without you even though you were so sweet about it*\n\n ‚Äú That means we'll have time to actually really sit on a bench by a lake ü´†ü¶¢üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nSee, originally I had assumed that, because obviously your English does not read like it would be your second language, but then I remembered that 1) you are brilliant and 2) it was statistically more likely. Sorry for assuming, and right after you‚Äôd just said you didn‚Äôt want to assume about my Spanish fluency. You have my permission to call me a dimwit and throw a stapler at me. \n\nThe main reason I‚Äôd looked into going back to uni was because I was considering moving abroad and needed a reason to be there for years while also not just moving there to do the same thing. If I were to stay in the same field, I‚Äôd like to at least do something more rewarding (even if not necessarily more enjoyable), like working at a game studio. Making games is very difficult and you usually get paid less üòÖ but at least you have something work-related to get excited about. Otherwise, there‚Äôs a few things I could do that are related to the field but not as draining, like systems architecture, cybersecurity or even UX design, those are somewhat adjacent. If I woke up with Bezos money, I‚Äôd probably just study music production or creative writing, BUT obviously not if I had any actual financial commitments üòÇ. A kind of ideal scenario would be to arrive somewhere to study part-time to ‚Äùget a foot in the door‚Äù in another unrelated field (say, electrician or something), whilst working a job in one‚Äôs current field. That said, I‚Äôm flexible, and this is all subject to change in the event that there‚Äôs a huge shift in the labour market. Also, the place plays a factor, different markets reward the same skills differently. \n\nOk this is absolutely cracking me up ü§£ I was reading the part where you say \"the Kombucha gave the NDT personality\" I'm like what could she mean by that? üòÖ I've been using NDT as short for Neil deGrasse Tyson ever since that time we were talking about him. What have you been picturing??? üòÇüòÇ. \n\nOne of my responsibilities from ages able-to-walk until I left for uni was to collect the newspapers from the mailbox every morning. We always got a finance one and a regional one containing general news (\"General News\" ü´°). I never liked that they came sealed in plastic. I always loved the finance one, specially when they had stories that you'd never think to look up, like about how the cost of some random commodity being higher had likely been catalysed some seemingly unrelated event from months before. My father would always read one in the morning and the other one on his lunch break from work. On Sundays we went to a newsstand that got monthly magazines from the states, Germany and other places. I never read the regional paper, so I never knew what was going on in the area üòÖ. In highschool, my friend/drummer's family owned the local newspaper (since forever), and I remember thinking that with the way the internet was taking over everything, ours would probably be the last generation where that was even a viable business model, and that made me a little sad too. So I do greatly miss the newspaper, it's a very nostalgic thing for me, like a time capsule. And that smell... ahhhhh, ink fumes. I do however feel sorry for all the trees.\n\nYes!!! You may regret asking anything related to e-ink. *Inhales deeply* The whole point of e-ink is that it's not actually a screen in the traditional sense. Unlike any other screen technology (CRT, plasma, LCD, LED, RLCD, OLED, etc.), there's no light array used to display image, there's no backlight (there's a front-light you can turn on, but that's really just an array of tiny lightbulbs that sits on top, instead of behind, the reading panel. This serves the same use as a lightbulb for physical books). The way it produces image is through lots of tiny \"ink\" capsules that change values, from totally filled (black) to empty, to thousands of grey values in between. It's pure chemistry and amazing use of electrical principles working together with the computer to tell them how to rearrange themselves. The ink capsules stay in that same charge until the image changes, this is why e-readers last weeks to months on a charge. As a result of all this, it is essentially the same as reading on paper, so it doesn't strain your eyes any more than paper would. \n\nI've been reading black and white e-ink since the Sony PRS-505 and never really minded not having colour üòÖ BUT I always wanted book covers to show up when the device was sleeping, I waited so many years for that, I was SO happy when we finally got it. To this day I stare at the cover for a bit before and after reading sessions üòÖ. I even have a whole automated workflow to download the books to my computer and make the covers fit right, before sending them to my Kindle, because otherwise you get huge black bars on either side of the cover, and that looks super lame (come on, Amazon, seriously?). Also, from a practical standpoint, book covers can be different sizes by default (\"...like on a bookshelf?\" üòÖ), so the books don't even line up in your library! It makes it harder to navigate when you have a lot of titles. All of this is to say, I really love my book covers, which is one of the main selling points of colour e-readers, but I'm not sure it's worth the trade-off. With our current tech, the screen has to be made darker to display colours, so you need the front-light on 24/7. I'll stick with B&W for now. Are you happy about the fact that newspapers are not so popular anymore and that print journalism is basically going extinct?\n\n*Thinks that maybe she intended to phrase it like that for exactly this reason* \nI was hoping you‚Äôd say something like that, I just wanted to hear it from you ü´†. Feel free to take the following sentence ‚Äòout of context‚Äô: In my mind it will always be you who thought Air Buddies was about dogs playing football.",

Ok, noted, no parrots in imaginary housing/residence/domicile. I may have made myself melt a little bit with that last sentence ü´†. \n\nOk, ok, Part II will come tomorrow. I hope that a certain someone notes that I do actually go to bed when she asks so that she doesn't have to worry that I'm still writing my reply at 3 am, and I hope that that certain someone will please do the same for me when I ask so that I won't have to worry about her  writing her reply at 3 am either, even if she does puppy eyes because she knows she's a total cutie patootie.",

And I think if you can find a way to phase out most of the negativity then Earth is not such a bad place after all. Besides, it's the people not the planet that's creating the problems. I think if we could have been sent to another planet from a younger age then it would also have been easier to adapt to it. *Imagines us as kids, being sent to the same planet on our own (We could totally survive as they sent a robot to help look after us until we've reached a certain age.). Sees us discovering new animal and plant species on planet. Building forts and telling each other made up stories to make up for the lack of literature on the planet. Fast forward to us being older and having to write scientific journals about the planet and report back to Earth. We have managed to build a small house at this point, which is filled with storybooks we wrote as kids. We somehow made medicine using the plants on the planet and have several pets. One day, we saw a spacecraft landing on our planet with five passengers inside. They were sent to join us on the planet. *insert ominous music*. Will we all get along? Will they understand that even though the animals here have a tendency to bite your toes off, they are still adorable? The possibilities are endless.*\nThis reminded me of the movie \"IO\" for some reason with Anthony Mackie and just as I was about to ask if you've watched it before, I remembered you haven't watched movies in sooo long üòÇ but that was a really good movie for me, not for Rotten Tomatoes. Also, this makes me want to watch movies with you so badly ü•π\n\"If I did go, I'd probably end up drawing a smiley face on my Kindle and calling it \"Wilson\" like in Castaway. üòÇ\n\nOoohhh that sounds interesting! So for the whole duration of November you have to try to write a rough first draft of a book right? (We can keep our messages super short in November, no problem!) I think it's great that you are doing that! Your books is going to be about superheroes right?üòÇ I'll be very dissapointed if not. \n(Kindly note that the word \"dissapointed\" in this context does not possess the dictionary definition, nor any definition really. It is merely used as a filler word with absolutely no meaning at all) \n\nThat game was way more fun than it was supposed to be üòÇ and it was very important to decide which colour gun you will have before playing so that you can inform your friend when there is an upgrade for that gun on your side of the screen. Yes! It's almost like Space Invaders. I'm not even entirely sure if I played Space Invaders before, but I know the game obviously. \n\n\"I was...wait, wrong format.\" üòÇüòÇ\nThat whole paragraph made me imagine you as LEGO Batman üòÇ\n*Thanks you dearly for gigantic bouquet of roses, tries to take it from your arms without falling down. Gets chased by massive swarm of bees, runs through field of cacti, dives into the ocean, gets stung by a stingray, hides in a barn, gets kicked by a horse, hides behind a restaurant's \"Specials\" board, gets charged full price, eats overpriced ice-cream while waiting for bees to catch up, they find me behind the board, they see the specials menu, ask me to pause while they order ice-cream, they get charged discounted price, they're finished, unpause, I run into an arcade, jumps into arcade game, looks left and right, discovers I'm in Pac-Man, bees fly into the same game, they turn into the ghost, a frantic chase starts, I jump out of game, bees are stuck in game. I return to you looking like Billy's nose from \"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\" with bouquet of roses untouched and in pristine condition. We go back to the arcade to rescue the bees. They apologise. We give them their own gigantic bouquet of roses.*\n\n\"I was relieved to then immediately read that you saw the puppies playing somewhere after that.\" \nYou are just the most adorable ü•∫\n\nYes I love horses! We grew up living on a farm, so I rode horses quite often as a kid. But now my perspective on that has changed quite a bit and I would feel too guilty to ride a horse. \nYour aunt did horseback riding competitions? That is SO cool! \nWait, are you afraid of horses? üòÇ \nWait again, were you on a horse's back then the horse started running with you as you got chased by wasps, or did you alone get chased by wasps, or did the horses chase you? üòÇ \n\"Oh how I ran, I ran like the roadrunner on Red Bull that day, but they still got me, twelve of them.\" üòÇ okay so I feel like you were not on a horse's back when it happened.\n\n\"adjusts the water flow to 'hair & toaster'\"üòÇüòÇüòÇ this was brilliant! üëèüèª\n\"Wraps blanket around you, puts Despicable Me plaster on your head, seals it with a kiss that feels like five seconds but is actually five minutes long...\" ü´†\n\"...gets poked in the eye by still- growing hair but doesn't care\" ü•∫üòÇ\nThat whole paragraph was extremely sweet ü•π\n\n(reply on rest coming soon!)",

Almost nauseous from excitement! *cuts lock of hair and places it in envelope already*\nIt only makes sense that you chose Phlebas. It relates to medicine/science, and it comes from a poem.

Sorry, I know it's brutal but the law is the law. \n\nMaking games sounds like an awesome career. And the lower salary (in my opinion) shouldn't be a huge factor if you'd still be making a reasonable amount to live on comfortably and you'd actually be happy with your job. It doesn't make sense to me having a job that brings no satisfaction. No one should be miserable or unsatisfied for 8+ hours a day. Life is too short. I guess it depends on what kind of life you want to have and what's important to you and what brings you joy. \n\"...different markets reward the same skills differently.\" Yes! \nAnd also, having a generally lower-paying career doesn't necessarily mean you'll be making less money. There are so many people making more money in \"low paying careers\" than \"high paying careers\" just because they are exceptional in what they do. But I get that it's also rare, and that people want/need security. So yes, once again, decisions, decisions. \n\"A kind of ideal scenario would be to arrive somewhere to study part-time to 'get a foot in the door' in another unrelated field (say, electrician or something)...\" I agree that studying something unrelated is a good idea to keep options open for the future. That was what I wanted to do as well. But haven't figured out what that \"something unrelated to study\" is yet. \n\nOooohhhhh üòÇüòÇüòÇ yeah no, I didn't think of it as Neil deGrasse Tyson at all!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ you know what, let's leave it at that.

I really like hearing stories of your childhood or school days or just any stories you tell me. \nI can relate to feeling sorry for all the trees.

It's something as small as black bars on either side of the cover that would prevent me from ever starting to read the book.\n\"With our current tech, the screen has to be made darker to display colours...\" should I ask why or should I rather Google it?üòÖ I don't want you to spend hours typing something that I could have easily Googled, but I also don't want to deprive you of the opportunity to talk about Kindle. \n\n\"Feel free to take the following sentence 'out of context': In my mind it will always be you who thought Air Buddies was about dogs playing football.\" \nOut of context it is taken ü´† \n\nOh my goodness üòÇ I can only imagine reading something like that. I'm glad your survival instincts kicked in and stopped you from doing that üòÖ it sounds like slavery. \n\nI'm so glad you didn't actually read that, I would have felt really bad if the Andromeda and Perseus situation repeated itself once again üòÖ That was just a random citation for \"to be or not to be.\" I feel like I should give you some signal in the future if I actually have some secret meaning to something that you need to go and decipher, but that would also destroy the purpose. So I'll just stick to you having to decide for yourself üòÇ, you seem to have good judgement for when to analyze and when to not since the whole Andromeda and Perseus incident. You are probably scarred for life. Are you experiencing any signs of PTSD?\n\nI don't like how the guy with the writer glasses in your head talks to you. He should change his tone. \nI can't recall that I have, but I have seen them in movies and they are adorable. Maybe they are just good actors? \n\nThat's also very true! When I had a cat back in South Africa, I raised him as a house cat. I was always too scared he would get into fights or get run down by a car (immediately has a talk with brain to erase the memory of that sentence) or something, but I also felt guilty because he should be able to explore and do cat things. (The first time I took him outside, he was afraid of grass.) But I was also concerned about the hunting and wouldn't have been able to deal with him bringing some animal back home. It's really hard raising a cat, damn. There really is no winning at that. \n\n\"I would have so much fun with that..\" \nHow?üòÇ How can you have fun with that? If the bird screams, you scream louder? üòÇ Also, I imagined that just now and it made me chuckle. \n\"I may have made myself melt a little bit with that last sentence ü´†\"\nI may have melted with you just now with your last sentence ü´†\n\n\"I hope that a certain someone notes that I do actually go to bed when she asks so that she doesn't have to worry that I'm still writing my reply at 3 am, and I hope that certain someone will please do the same for me when I ask so that I won't have to worry about her writing her reply at 3 am either...\" \nThat certain someone deeply appreciates you going to bed when she asks because she genuinely worries about you. But that certain someone also asks that you understand that she can't always go to bed when you ask because if she doesn't feel like she has spent enough time in a day texting you, then it will feel like there's something missing that day and it won't be a good day. So she not only stays up typing for the sake of your happiness, but also for her own. \n\n\"I am sending you more long hugs than there are photons in the observable universe. I'm fixing your hair, sending you forehead kisses, tucking your hair behind your ear, holding your hand in mine and giving you kisses on your cheeks.\" \nThis text gave me so many butterflies ü¶ãü´†\n\nRegarding the tiny letter placed in the ice-cream cone- yes, I do have the top half! \nI think we should bring the two pieces together to see what is says though. But I can tell you I have a part that almost looks like McDonald's' \"M\" but it's red.\n\nI just woke up from my nap and I reread your message about Only Wanna Be With You, and I listened to it again. Waking up to that song and thinking about you is honestly one of the best feelings in the world. \n\"Also, I've been finding myself humming that song when I'm doing things on autopilot, I like it.\" \nThis makes me so incredibly happy to hear ü•π I've been thinking about that song Banana Pancakes quite a lot since you sent it (listening to it as I'm replying). You did such a beautiful cover and it always makes me think of us just chilling at home on a rainy day, watching movies and you singing something for me (ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´† melting as I'm thinking about it again).\n\"I shall not comment on behalf of the universe, but I will say, potatoes.\" üòÖü•∫\n\n\"that is otterly adorable\" üòÖü•∫\nIt's guaranteed the person would not have that on their bingo card. Also because I fully live by the delusion that no one else in the world has bingo cards. It's an us thing. \n\nMe reading \"‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èü¶ãü¶ãü¶ã\" almost made my whole life flash in front of my eyes ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü´†ü´†ü´†\n\n\"Reading 'GAME OVER' reminded me of that time you said 'you are now one step closer to saving the princess' ü•π\" \nI think you already reached the boss level and saved the princess a long time ago ü•π\n\n\"*clicks 'info' button*\"\n\"Congratulations! If you are here, it means your character experienced something we like to call 'euphoria.' Euphoria is an extremely rare emotion and can only be triggered by one very specific character in the game. When your character is in the state of euphoria, there are a few things you need to be weary of: They might find themselves randomly smiling throughout the day. Now this might not seem harmful or something to be concerned about, but the NPC's might think your character has been infected by some virus and plan an attack. Your character might also zone out and engage in intense daydreaming sessions. This can happen at the most inconvenient times and we suggest that you not send your character into battle during this state. It's also advisable that your character stays within a 1mm radius from the character that caused the euphoria, or her health will rapidly decrease, leading to certain death.\"\n\nI'm glad you liked the giant butterfly saddle üòÇ it was designed by Edna from The Incredibles.\n\"I did wake up hugging you I mean my pillow again, I remember being very happy about the dream,\" ü´† \n*Sees the word \"happy\", nods to self.

I also agree that it is quite fun seeing things from the more \"spoOoky\" angle even though I still can't get over the \"flood-Fludd\" situation. And I also do believe sometimes being logical is not really \"logical\" because there has to be something more to all of this, something beyond our comprehension, so the open-minded side of me tries really hard to accept \"flood-Fludd\".

Well, yes, briefly. I got on the stage to play every chance I could (it‚Äôs one of my favourite things to do), but it was usually by myself (I just remembered there was a picture of 11-year-old me playing the violin all alone at one of those events, I wonder if it‚Äôs still lying around somewhere). The music teacher and I got along splendidly and he‚Äôd always tag me to lead group-based performances where it was kids from different years üòÇ I‚Äôm not counting those as bands because the groups changed.  \n My friend, I never asked why, lived alone. This meant that we could go to his house after school sometimes and jam out, which of course was fun. I‚Äôd sing and play rhythm guitar and this other kind from another school played lead guitar, and there was another kid who played bass from yet another school as well. After a while, we started jamming out with these two kids from our school who were a year younger, one was on bass and the other had keys & backing vocals.  One time we somehow ended up signing up for some school event as a band, ‚Äúthe Rickies‚Äù (after our bass man, Ricky üòÇ). That time I got to play bass and backing vocals, except for when it came time to sing AC/DC (I‚Äôm not a devil worshipper), which was a spur-of-the-moment ask by the band, we never practised that song before, but the crowd loved it (teenage angst). I also unfortunately kind of had to take over the vocals during the chorus of Munich by Editors, which had been my pick for the setlist and during which Tony got a little shy for some reason. Overall, a very fun day.\n\n  Thanks! I really like hearing your stories too :)\n\nThat made me feel a little bad for the squirrels üòÖ so I looked it up and found an article by Scientific American from 2023 that has a lot of interesting data. Did you know ‚ÄúA single squirrel can bury up to 3,000 nuts in a season‚Äù? I didn‚Äôt. They also cite a study *chuckles in a smug way* which I had just read on Science Direct before clicking on the ‚ÄúSci-Am‚Äù article,   and which observed that the squirrels in the study ‚Äúcould plan a trajectory through their 10 caches, which they could only do if they had a memory of where those caches were‚Äù. Maybe they‚Äôre purposefully leaving the older and not-as-desirable nuts behind as they get better stock? Just like when you‚Äôre at the supermarket and you hide the good package at the back and leave the destroyed one at the front, so that your competition will take those instead, and then you can come back and get the good one after you‚Äôve made a decision later. Don‚Äôt pretend like you haven‚Äôt done that, I see you.  \n\nI‚Äôm really glad you find the story interesting! I really ought to finish that one. By the way, have I told you that you make me happy? Because you do *sneaks in quick kiss on your cheek*.\n\nYou too?! *pulls out bingo card, sad to hear that you also get digital _screen-related headaches*. About why colour e-readers are currently darker than their black & white counterparts, it‚Äôs because the colour part of it comes from a layer that sits on top, called a ‚Äùfilter array‚Äù.

I imagined you singing it as you said you had to take over the vocals from Tony. \n\n3000?! That's self-inflicted slavery! \nIt also makes sense that maybe they purposefully leave the older nuts behind as they get new ones, either way, I'm just glad about the trees and that squirrels contribute towards an anti-Once-ler movement. \nI certainly didn't expect to get called out for hiding good packages at the back when I woke up today.

I also made you an agua de jamaica and drew a doodle on a tiny piece of paper which I placed next to the pancakes. I tried to arrange pieces of dragonfruit in a heart with an arrow through it, but it came out terribly which later would turn into some inside joke we would occasionally reference at random moments. While I'm busy preparing everything, I imagined you waking up and appearing in the kitchen, covered in a blanket and giving me a hug from behind, wrapping the blanket around me so we're both inside it. \n\n\"I tie our shoelaces together\" this is probably the most underrated romantic gesture ever. If I ever see some kids doing this, I'm taking pictures and framing it.

My chest is a tornado of butterflies and my eyes are starting to tear up a little. This is all I want. I kiss your hand, you turn to look at me-*\n*VHS rewinds a lot further at 50X speed, it stops in the present at this exact moment. Technician: ‚Äúoops, sorry guys! All good now, continue‚Äù*\n\n(No, I won‚Äôt forget that you told me you might have teared up a little bit because I don‚Äôt know if you could hear it in the recording but it was emotional for me to sing that, I was picturing that you were in front of me when I recorded it. I always picture I‚Äôm singing to you, that‚Äôs why they always come out sounding a little clumsy üòÖ).\n\nI am so glad that you enjoy my reading of The Hobbit because I would not be totally opposed to reading you a chapter or two in bed sometime (I just pictured doing all the dramatic bits and acting it out üòÇüòÇ).\n\n‚ÄúWho am I kidding, I think about you all the time.‚Äù\nWho am I kidding, I think about you all the time.\n\n*Scours the world for a box of Despicable Me plasters*\n\n‚ÄúOuchy, my cheek hurts so much‚Äù is so cute ü•∫.\n\nThat part with the voluntary sterilisation also made me laugh üòÇüòÇ. I share in the comedic opinion, but then, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much guarantee that a person‚Äôs lineage will be a reflection of their logical faculties.\n\nI never watched Frozen 2, only the first one. The water quote reminded me of a book I had in my Wishlist a long time ago, but when I looked for it, I couldn‚Äôt find it! It had a title like ‚ÄúWater: [‚Ä¶] mystery/molecule/life‚Äù and there‚Äôs about a million books with variations of that title, ughhh.\n\nThe ‚ÄúFludd‚Äù thing was like watching a bad horror movie where the writers somehow got production on board with only 10% of the script ready and had to improvise the rest, so the protagonist has a ‚Äúeureka‚Äù moment at the end that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but ends up saving the day. When I was very young I read a book about Einstein and it said that there‚Äôs enough energy contained in the atoms of a regular ball pen to out-do an A-bawmb (by means of fission, not just by throwing it at people. You would have to be really strong for that), so there‚Äôs probably a simple way to connect a pen to a supernova too. I may have never watched Friends, but I know Phoebe is rather woo-woo, right? (I‚Äôm delighted I got to use the word ‚Äúwoo-woo‚Äù in a sentence).\n\nI pictured your new Cupid addition and I gave him a roughed up beanie and a smear of grease on his cheek like he‚Äôs one of the robbers in Home Alone üòÇ.\n\n‚ÄúYou know that feeling you get when you go down a very high and fast roller coaster?

As cute as that would be if I‚Äôd written it after our cheese rolling bit, I wrote the start of it in September of 2023. It‚Äôs rather rough because it was just for my daily exercise where I like to write without stopping, but here‚Äôs a little excerpt:\n\n[Bobby adjusted his cowboy hat as he entered ‚ÄúBetty‚Äôs Cheese‚Äù, trying to look cool. There was no one  at the counter. A few seconds later, Maggie emerged, the ten-year-old daughter of the proprietor. ‚ÄúHey Bobby, err, mister Bobby, how can we help you today?‚Äù She said, trying to look professional. ‚ÄúHey Maggie, is your mom around?‚Äù. She frowned. ‚ÄúYes, but she‚Äôs busy‚Äù. ‚ÄúCould you ask her to come out for a minute? It‚Äôs kind of important‚Äù. She looked outraged. ‚ÄúFine‚Äù, she said, and stomped off to the back. There was a thump on a door, and whispers were exchanged. After a minute, a plump, middle-aged woman walked up to the counter, looking as if she‚Äôd been sleeping. She stared at Bobby. He stared back, thinking she smelled oddly un-cheese-like, something like Maraschino cherries. He tipped his cowboy hat. ‚ÄúHowdy, Mrs. Boyd, I -‚Äù she cut him off, ‚ÄúWhat can we do for you today?‚Äù . He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúStraight to bidness‚Äù he said, and cringed. ‚ÄúWell, see, I‚Äôm with the school newspaper, we‚Äôre doing a piece about the stolen cheddar, but I‚Äôm also doing an independent-‚Äù. She stared at his hat, unblinking. He continued, ‚Äúsee, I have a unique set of skills, that -‚Äú, she cut him off, ‚ÄúLook son, there isn‚Äôt much to tell. I closed up, come morning, wheel was gone, that‚Äôs it. I already told that Henderson kid with the newspaper. But we‚Äôll be ok now, I had the locks changed, plus we got a dog to guard the door at night‚Äù, she pointed to the chihuahua sleeping in the corner.]\n\nBut speaking of projects, I‚Äôve been working on a little surprise for you (that‚Äôs why my messages have been a little bit shorter lately. I know this makes it a little less of a surprise, that‚Äôs ok), it‚Äôll still be a little while before it‚Äôs ready, but I can‚Äôt wait to show you. \n\nI can‚Äôt believe you played Enduro too! Not a lot of people seem to know about it, so that‚Äôs really cool.\n\n‚Äúwith my head resting on your shoulder, running my fingertips softly across your back while you play games and every now and then, I would give your shoulder a kiss.‚Äù Reading this made time stop for me, I now can‚Äôt stop imagining your head on my shoulder and your fingers running across my backüíòü¶ãü´†. I‚Äôd just play with one hand so I could run my fingers across your back too, and we watch me lose over and over at the videogame. \n\n‚ÄúI'm really glad you liked me calling you that ü•∫‚Äù\n\nTo be quite honest, ‚Äúliked‚Äù is an understatement. Then again, there aren‚Äôt many things you could call me that I wouldn‚Äôt like. Except maybe for ‚Äú$!#%^ sack of #&^%@$&‚Äù and ‚Äú@$^$@!!!‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúAnd I feel like a complete idiot for feeling about you the way that I do.‚Äù That low-key sounds like a diss üòÖ. I feel the same way about you, but it makes me feel like a complete genius because there‚Äôs no better person to feel this way about than you, nobody. (But I know exactly what you mean and it makes me so happy that you said that).\n\nWhen you said you had the day off I almost asked if you wanted to have a phone call, but I didn‚Äôt want to bother you. I wonder, what does Karla Swanepoel do on her day off? *cue ‚ÄúFerris Bueller‚Äôs Day Off‚Äù opening monologue*.\n\nI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve sent me voice notes because now I can read your messages in your voice ü´†. Also, you mentioned re-listening to my voice notes, do you just scroll infinitely up until you reach them? I‚Äôve been doing that üòÇ.\n\n  ‚Äúa tornado of butterflies inside of me ü¶ãüå™‚Äù is exactly how you make me feel all the time, but especially when you say words like ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúkisses‚Äù and ‚Äúhugs‚Äù and ‚Äúcuddles‚Äù and ‚Äúholding your had in mine and tracing your fingerprints with my fingertip‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®üë´. \n\n(I know that‚Äôs not one word, but this is no time for grammer!)\n\n‚ÄúSomething about its job description that suddenly changed since I met you and it feels overworked.‚Äù sweetest ü•∫ü•∫. It‚Äôs the same with my heart ü´Ä. \n\nI have been feeling better yes, thank you so much! See I told you singing to you would help.\n\n‚ÄúHires a random person and pays them an extreme amount of money in $1 bills over a period of 7 years to fabricate the results.‚Äù üòÇüòÇü•∫\n\nYour goodnight message just now made a lot of different music play in my head at the same time. Songs like ‚ÄúBeyond the Sea‚Äú, I‚Äôm A Believer, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Making Believe‚Äù (again) and Only You, by The Platters. I too have been looking into teleportation extensively and whilst my research is not yet complete, I do believe there is promising progress underway. \n\nUntil then, I‚Äôm sending you kisses for your cheeks and forehead, your hands, your shoulder and the sides of your eyes, and I‚Äôm cuddling my Karla pillow until I fall asleep. I hope you're having a fun and relaxing day off and continue to do so. Goodnight, sweetest üåõüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®ü¶≠‚ù§Ô∏èü¶¶ü¶ãüíòüë´üòò",

He's winning, she doesn't pay any attention to the board at all, she just like moving the horse around. He's focused and analyses every move. She stares at him as he stares at the board. She leans over the board for a kiss. The game ends unfinished. Pictures start flashing again and pauses at one of them in the living room. The room is dimly lit and there's a storm outside. They are on the couch cozied up under blankets. He's teaching her how to play the guitar as she  presses the chords and he strums. It's starting to rain too loudly to hear the guitar so they put it away and curl op cuddling under the blanket, staring out the window at the lightning. She pulls his arms tighter around her and whispers something to him. The pictures start flashing again and pauses at a picture of them unloading boxes from a moving van. He complains about all the boxes with books and the fact that she hasn't switched to Kindle yet. She kisses him to make him stop talking. She complains about the Darth Vader cookie jar he refuses to get rid of even though it doesn't fit with the decor. He kisses her to make her stop talking. They are halfway finished unpacking and call it a day. They take a look around and think to themselves that it's perfect. Even though there's one spot on the floor that's squeaky and the washing machine makes a weird noise and the neighbours have terrible taste in music and one of the windows get stuck sometimes which makes the rain come inside, none of that matters.

Only You by The Platters ü´†ü´†ü•∫\nYou make me feel \"Only One\" by Kodaline. \n\nAlso, good morning cutest! ‚òÄÔ∏è\nI hope you're having a great morning so far and that you'll continue to have a great day. I'm happy to know you. *insert Paperweight by Joshua Radin and Schuyler Fisk and only keep the good parts* \nAlso, I randomly remembered again that we will probably be reading chapter 3 of our book this weekend (?) and it sent a rush of happiness through me. \nI'm sending you so many hugs and cuddles that you'd need an oxygen mask to help you breathe. I'm kissing your forehead, your cheeks, your hands, your shoulder, your chest and your chin. Goodnight, sweetest üåôüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®üë´üíòü¶ãüå™‚ô•Ô∏èüòò",

Ok, they might like it. The guy might be a musician too, we could start a band and call it \"The What's Ups\". \n\nYou're probably about to wake up  looking all cute ü•π (I just pictured you sleeping next to me and felt it in my heart üíò).\nYour message gave me a billion tap-dancing butterflies ü¶ãüëûüëû. Next message will come later (please let me know if you'd rather I send it on WhatsApp by replying to this with one emoji, you already know which one.
