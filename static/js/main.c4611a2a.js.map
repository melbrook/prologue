But I also like fun things like dragon fruit (coolest name of any fruit), bamboo shoots, baby corn, nopal cactus, courgette flower, chayote, etc. Favourite dish might be enchiladas filled with a variety of steamed veggies, served on a bed of creamy, roasted red bell pepper sauce.

I love classical music, jazz 🐝, all kinds of pop, rock, \\\"alternative\\\", folk, videogame & film music, etc. My favourite composer is Beethoven, favourite solo songwriter is Mitski, fave lyricist might be Bob Dylan. My top albums are Is This It by The Strokes and Be The Cowboy by Mitski. I love STRFKR, Radiohead, Gorillaz, Deadmau5, Plenty (most underrated band ever!)

I haven't studied Afrikaans, but I still found the name vetkoek funny, I knew it would come in handy someday! (I never reached any degree of fluency).\\n\\nYesss! And... not atm, haha. I've released a whole bunch of music over the years. I never much cared to distribute it properly (in retrospect, this may have been a mistake lol) but I'd put out a new album every couple of years under some random new alias and upload it to its own little website, repeat 😅. I think most if not all of those are probably lost to the sands of the internet, but I could dig around tomorrow/later and see what I can find. BUT anyway, I've been working on these 2 new albums since 2021. The pop one is fully written and produced, except for the vocals, all that's left is to record all the voices... for all 31 songs + the B-side 😅. I was supposed to do that through September at a studio but then I caught a horrible throat infection that checkmated me really bad! When I went to see my ent, he said my vocal folds were extremely swollen and advised vocal rest for a couple months, so I've pushed it back to Q1 of next year (no way am I releasing around December at the height of Mariah Carey's power, she's already defrosting once again! 🥶). For the electronic album I've got somewhere between 20 to 25 finished tracks atm, those are all instrumentals though and most are pretty simple, not sure if that's your thing but I could share one.\\n\\nBut wait, there's more! \\nI do have a few rather old (and almost embarrassing lol) song covers on YouTube, they're just for fun but I could upload a more recent one tomorrow. \\n\\nLet me know which one you'd like, funny song cover or original track, choose wisely! \\n\\nI'm curious about your hobbies too, if you'd like to share!\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-09-28T08:53:49.106Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sender\": \"Karla\",\n    \"text\": \"😂 \\\"slips dollar bill\\\" to Google. \\n\\nThey are the best!

I also like artsy stuff like writing, painting (even though me holding a paintbrush should be illegal in at least 108 countries, and I'm pretty convinced that if heaven exists, I won't be allowed to paint there either), reading, and I want to learn to play piano in the future :) \\nAnd then exclusively in my mind, I like surfing. But in reality I won't ever even attempt it. This thing called sharks you know. Oh and back home I used to love ice skating as well. Was funny to see people wearing helmets and knee-guards here in the ice skating rink.

Hmmm, I finished Dungeon Crawler Carl about 3 days ago and I'm now almost done with the second book in the series. The audiobook is incredibly funny, it's got a lot of action-packed scenes and you can tell the narrator had so much fun recording it, he'll go all-out yelling like a sports commentator one second, then do a convincing female cat the next, it's LEGEN- wait for it... (but also the books are quite violent, gross and cruel, which is really not my thing at all, but it just works so well here that I can't complain) DARY.\\n\\nRight before that, I finished the Super Powereds series (Harry Potter in university with superpowers) but I had to burn through them at 1.75x speed because the prose is some of the worst I've ever read but the story is just sooo good.

As in a \\\"there is no way anyone will ever produce this combination of sounds, this password is totally safe!\\\". Also, we don't know how the hypothetical password-distribution system would work in this scenario, maybe they were randomly generated. If you create a random password generator, could you really be held liable for anything it outputs? So in that way, I believe I may be in the clear... and what do these passwords unlock, anyway? So many questions (specific sounds that unlock things in the natural world... there's a book in there somewhere, something something I should rip off and remix Ready Player One, Cradle and Percy Jackson).\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-09-29T17:43:09.131Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sender\": \"Karla\",\n    \"text\": \"Omg you are giving me flashbacks to the days of Looney Tunes, Cow and Chicken, Courage the Cowardly Dog, The Flinstones, Ben 10, Tom and Jerry, Kim Possible, Foster's Home For Imaginery Friends, Ed Edd n Eddy, Dexter's Laboratory......😶‍🌫️\\nYour description was sniper-level accurate! \\n\\n😂omg, overstimulated by all your imagery!

I don't know Flight of the Conchords, but now I want to go listen to the original song! \\n\\nI exaggerated a little bit 😅 but I really have rewatches that show sooooo many times. Definitely at least 10 times from S1-S9. I watched it for the first time when I was like 10 years old I think, rewatched it during the school holidays when my cousins came to visit, watched it when I visited my brother after he moved away after graduation, watched it all throughout high school (even when it was 1 day before a big exam, and watched it again after the exam for comfort once I realized I never should have watched it before an exam), rewatched it every December holiday, every weekend after high school while studying, and I think the last time I watched it was after I finished studying and started working. My life consisted of himym catchphrases, inside jokes and parallels for so long. It is definitely one of my favourite shows. Others would be This Is Us & Prison Break. \\nI know the majority of the people absolutely hate the ending of himym and how anticlimactic it was, but it was kinda obvious the whole time that Ted's wife would never get the amount of attention in the show that Robin got, so the ending was expected. His obession with Robin became annoying after some time though, especially when he planned on sleeping with Robin while he was still in a relationship with Victoria. Gosh I got mad at that. I almost stopped watching the show after the +-8th rewatch due to that 😂\\nDamn sorry for all the himym ranting. \\n\\n\\n\\\"They are, after all, the berries\\\" 😅\\nI love berries too! Acting like it is highly unusual for two people to have that in common, but I doubt anyone dislikes berries. How can you dislike berries?

Nevertheless, it sounds very interesting!

It's soooo pretty! \\n\\nI'm also not familiar with Dungeon Crawler Carl, so went to look it up as well. It sounds really great! It's apparently humorous and he even travels through a dungeon with his cat!

The chair said some things it didn't mean, I said some things that I did in fact mean. Things got out of control, there were splinters involved. I had to analyse if I still like berries after the incident. Turned out I still did, so the journey proceeded. \\n\\nThat is a very interesting hypothesis you've got there Socrates *takes a puff from my pipe* very interesting indeed.

I think I'd been expecting a huge twist for the ending ever since S7E12. I love that show so much, but it made me so sad when it ended that I only ever re-watched the first few episodes when afflicted with the Flu debuff and I needed comforting.

I don’t remember what came first, the heat or the kid running away. Suddenly, some invisible man had taken hold of my neck and was emptying a can of compressed air into my nose, like a sneeze in reverse, hot metal. I felt my heart pounding in my head and there was a Polaroid haze to the moment, I was afraid the world would be pulled out of me. The heat, rising in my thighs as the crowd, the limb-mass, encroached around my vision. I was a stubborn tooth in a pair of pliers, those slow and overwhelming moments where your body is trying to tell you how handsomely wrecked you are, but your brain doesn’t want to listen. \\n\\nI don’t remember what my arm looked like then, just brief flashes. Heat, blood, a stranger’s arms, haze. With my head hanging limp off the side of my hero’s shoulder as she sprinted along the top row of the main hall, I realised that nobody in the agora had noticed the wailing scene in the playground. How I hated that music they were playing.”\\n\\nI’ll be looking up that video shortly!\\n\\nAhhh, I can’t say no to that mental picture! *falls to one knee, clutching his chest*.

Enthusiasm around Halloween varies by state/city/neighbourhood/person, but in my area you always see kids (and sometimes adults going door to door as well, in suspiciously intricate costumes, under the guise of chaperones)  trick or treating. They'll even say \\\"trick or treat\\\" (albeit usually in Spanish) and I've even seen groups sing little Halloween songs in English, which feels like being transported to an episode of the Twilight Zone. I greatly enjoy Halloween, even though I’m not big into horror. \\n\\nOne universally loved thing about Day of the Dead is a type of bread you can only find in October, maybe up to the second week of November.

I don’t do well with endings either, so obviously avoiding the problem is the best solution. Do you easily finish reading books, or do you start to read slower and less as you get closer to the end as a way of avoiding it? \\n\\nI would like to hear which episodes you dreamt up, if you can remember any! Also, permission granted to dream whole new episodes for himym. By the way, have you ever watched The Office? I know it's quite renowned, but I never watched more than a few episodes. It's just soooo tedious. The type of humor is repetitive, which is kind of the same for most sitcoms. After a while, it's easy to guess what will be said/done next.\\n\\nI have had them in the past, yes! But it’s been a while since I last had any. I think it depends on the type of dream, but I remember once I dreamed that I was about to fall from a cliff and die, but instead of dying, I decided to not 🙃\\n\\nThat is so cool! I'm going to keep that in mind tonight if I dream. Summon a suit of armor and fly, Karla! Grocery shopping in your dream? 😅Damn, your dreams are exciting! (I once dreamed in black and white.) I would never even have thought about you kicking babies if you hadn't mentioned it. But roller skating in a grocery store sounds so '70s, and now that's all I will ever think about when I go grocery shopping. The only part of that paragraph I psychoanalyzed is the part where you trash things, which means you are probably not OCD. So, nothing bad.\\n\\nNope, the rock did not get this person a date, as the person was a girl 😅 I generally like the rock that David used to K.O. Goliath or the stone that King Arthur pulled the sword from. But you know, I'm easygoing, so I will also accept the Blarney Stone or Plymouth Rock. \\nThat is SO FREAKING CUTE, THOUGH! Penguins wooing the females with pebbles! 🥹 So innocent. It makes me think of swans that mate for life and become depressed when their partner passes away (Penguins too. Some other animals as well, actually.)\\n\\n😂So many things I will never look at the same again. *Imagines a future reality, eating Cocoa Puffs and getting into a heated argument as to why the bird dared to get involved in a meth business. Someone walks in and sees me talking to a cereal box. Send me to an asylum. Sees that everyone else at the asylum has my face, and I'm surrounded by 30 other Karlas. The dream becomes lucid, so I purchase meth from the Cocoa Puffs bird, having a trance party at the asylum with all my doppelgängers.*\\n\\n\\\"Gosh, I've scarred you for life! 😅 I hope you don't start switching the lights on and off 15 times before entering a room or clapping your hands every time someone splits their infinitives. I'm so sorry for introducing you to such an atrocious video.

I would also like to share that my cat's uncle once played A Tender Feeling to me on a Steinway & Sons Model D during an eerie August morning. He wore a white silk gown, which reminded me of the way dew clings to spider webs. My cat ate a spider once. Or was it the top of a Pan de Muerto?\\\" \\n\\n250 titles in your backlog?

I think the problem is when it’s both long-running and I’ve been reading them for several months or years and then I don’t want to finish it. For instance, I haven’t finished Cradle, my favourite series of all time, even though I’ve had the last book (12) since the day came out (I may have even pre-ordered it), but they’re so good that I had to read 2 of the first ones back to back in like 2 days, breaking my custom of not starting a new book the same day I’ve finished another.

I’ve found that sit-coms without a laugh-track have a higher propensity for wacky episodes and dialogue. Besides The Office, some of my favourites are The Thick of It (🐐), Community, Trial & Error and Parks & Recreations.

I've never read the Cradle series before, but I am vigorously taking notes ✍️🏻 and adding it to your simology. Ah man, I can only imagine having to read the last page of book #12! It must feel like saying goodbye to a part of yourself. That's probably what divorce feels like. Hey, if you finished reading book #12, you can technically say you've been divorced before. \\n*stares into the vast distance, trying to comprehend how—and, more importantly, why—I came to the topic of divorce*\\n*insert piano music equivalent to \\\"Everything is fcked\\\" by Mark Manson*\\n\\nReading two books in two days is very impressive, dang. \\nFor me, it doesn't necessarily depend on whether it was a long-running series or not, if I connected with the story, then reaching the end is always difficult.

Sitcoms are the only things I watch after work during the week, despite being bored into a vegetative state by rewatching the same ones over and over again. But I just don't have the mental energy to watch anything else. Wait, hold up there, sergeant. The Office is in your list of top favorite shows??! Okay, this just got real. Now I HAVE to find something that I like about it, even if it’s just the lighting or their office desk designs. \\n\\nThe Thick of It looks interesting. I absolutely love British humour!\\nTrial and Error also looks interesting! It's always refreshing to watch John Lithgow do his thing (low-key despise him for studying at Harvard though).\\nLavinia Peck-Foster \\\"is giving\\\" Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. Parks and Recreation also has great actors, even though I've never watched the show but have heard of it, of course. Nick Offerman has this vibe that he owes the mafia money and sharpens his knives on his belt buckle, but that he also secretly just wants a quiet life in the mountains, spending his time gardening and creating new fertilizers.

At this point, you are probably your own qualified psychologist. And I assume you are a perfectionist when it comes to your writing since you scrap most of them? Do you think that, instead of scrapping them, you should keep them in case you see them from a different angle in the future and realize that maybe they were actually great all along?

It is crazy to me how nobody has gone full Pixar villain by investing a lot of time, effort and money to gain the backing of all the crows in their general location (🫡 General Location!). I have a theory that having the backing of all the crows in a specific region could be life-saving if one finds themselves lost in the wilderness with no means of reaching human civilisation.

I think my reason for scrapping most of my work is that I don't want to ”dilute\\\" my catalogue.

But not because I don't like them, possibly just for the same reason I haven't befriended a snail either. \\n\\n\\\"It is crazy to me how nobody has gone full Pixar villain by investing a lot of time, effort and money to gain the backing of all the crows in their general location..\\\" 😂\\nGeneral Location 🫡\\nI'm sorry but if I get lost in the wilderness with no means of reaching human civilization, I'm staying put.\\nConsider it 'prayers answered'\\n\\\"I really want to meet a raven,\\\" instantly made me think, \\\"I'm sure there's an app for that somewhere\\\"\\n\\n*intensely watches as the new asylumees get off the bus for a guy with a raven on his shoulder* \\n\\nYou make a valid point Mr. Holmes. And doesn't the concept of accepting cookies go against the whole, \\\"My mom taught me not to accept candy from strangers,\\\" thing? Suddenly it feels like an episode of Black Mirror and we are all ironically responsible for our own death.\\n\\nAn army of penguins against AI. Damn that should definitely be a show, or a movie, or some graffiti on walls. The moral of the story will be how your pain (discarded pebbles) can be turned into power (defeating AI which was supposed to take over the world), then Mark Manson can write about it on people's Starbucks cups. \\n\\nOmg I can just imagine the tribe arriving at a Japanese restaurant, ready to meet their god. Japanese kids are staring at the pages of their comic books and back at the tribe, waiting for them to \\\"kamehameha\\\". The tribe is taking the children's stares as a sign that they have been expecting them. The tribe starts performing their Adumu, expecting Enkai to show up any minute, and the children, having watched Dragon Ball Z before, flee from the restaurant in fear of an attack on Japan. \\nJapan's Asahi Shimbun is cluttered with articles of a war starting between them and East Africa. \\nMoral of the story: You don't wanna meet your heroes. \\n\\nThat's a very good question! I have no idea, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. \\n\\nYou really don't have to do that! You can mix coffee with dish soap and I'll probably still drink it. My feelings for coffee is beyond Nicholas Sparks' comprehension. I don't need the best coffee in the world. \\n\\nI understand completely. Let's not jinx it then. I, myself, am one to avoid stepping on cracks and walking under ladders. So I have the deepest form of comprehension for you superstition. \\n\\nHhmmmm, 🕵‍♀️🧑‍⚕️🪩🕺🕺 saga:\\n*in fortune-teller voice, stroking my hands around a crystal ball* I am receiving energy from a room, it's dark, the room is empty, no, wait, there are two people in the room. In the centre of the room is a disco ball, rotating at 0.5x speed. A distorting mirror stands on the stage, for the randomness of it all. The one person is a woman. She has a magnifying glass, probably an entomologist, no, she's a detective. She stands under the disco ball. There's a guy.\\n*male voice in the background appears. Crowd gets chills* \\nThe guy is wearing....*curtain drops on the floor and reveals a guy speaking into a mic. I hastily reposition the curtain and gives the voice actor a stare that says 'your tip has been cut in half'. Clears throat and continues* The guy is wearing a white coat. He is a dentist. No, sorry, he is a doctor. The guy halts under the disco ball. They stare at each other, and they instantly know what the other is thinking. In a synchronized voice they utter the words, \\\"Victorian era-detective-who-has-a-god-complex-and-severely-unhealthy-anger-management-skills-themed disco party!\\\".\\n\\nI'm thinking that in the second book they can maybe kill Holmes and Moriarty for having childlike conflict resolution skills and end the night by eating ice-cream on the rooftop of the building in which they did the murdering. \\n\\nNow I have to watch it too because I've also never actually watched the movie. \\n\\nOohh really?! I found out about it recently actually. I watched Carrie for the first time a couple of years ago without even knowing that it was written by King. It's nice to know that I can read your mind *\\\"tries to wink but gets eyelash in my eye\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"Perfect is the enemy of good\\\" will be my new life philosophy, thank you for that. \\nAh, I understand. So it's a quality over quantity situation?\\n\\nYou will hear no \\\"possum snout\\\" from me either, but thank you very much for saying that. I'm also not easy to make uncomfortable. I grew up with an older brother (which speaks for itself), and a rather strange taste in friends. \\n\\nI couldn't win a battle with a cricket, what makes you think I can win a fanning duel with you? *throws palm leaf on the floor and sinks into your beach chair*\\n\\nThe fire dance worked!!!! Well, it worked 95%, which is basically the new 100%. \\n*reminds self that perfect is the enemy of good*\\n\\nOkay I have watched the first episode of season 2 and I actually laughed...out loud...more than 3 times. Especially where Michael talks about how he went out with a girl from HR and Dwight interrupts that they don't have a girl in HR and Michael says, \\\"for the sake of the story\\\" 😂 and later he says before things escalated she made him fill out six hours worth of paperwork and Dwight asks, \\\"Like an AIDS test?\\\" 😂\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-10-04T12:55:11.600Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sender\": \"Alberto\",\n    \"text\": \"I do love watery food!

We should get bingo cards. Ahh yes, fresh tears, the forbidden seasoning.  One time I half-watched Hachi on a flight and I had to fight back tears. Your penguin comment hits hard, you’re getting one of these -> 🥺 \\n\\nAhhhh yessss, finally! I knew I couldn’t be 100% of the total addressable market for vanilla ice-cream. Everyone always tells me it’s ”boring”, I’m like “your face is boring!”. *Pulls out bingo card to cross off vanilla ice cream* (Note: I’ve never played bingo). That whole paragraph made me so hungry! \\n\\nDangit, I was like “Divorce? Divorce again, and again… 💡”. I would never lure the storks with Alaskan fish! I used crack, it’s very effective!\\n\\nMy nine children would be delighted to play with your six, that would be splendid! Maybe we can all get some ice-cream too. For some reason, I just pictured an ice-cream truck but the driver is a pug. They just look like they know their gelato.  \\n\\n“I’m afraid she'll grow up to be too virtuous. You think your kids can mess her up a little bit? Not too much, though. I don't want her roaming the hallways of retirement homes as the Grim Reaper” 😂😂😂.  \\n\\nYou know, I actually might be on the side of Nora on this one. I’ve rehabilitated/saved so many little critters over the years: ants, a house gecko, a cricket, a spider,  a froggy, a dove, a kitten and even an iguana once! Mosquitoes manage to exhaust my patience after the 3rd warning though. This all sounds a little insane, until you consider that we spend a lot of resources looking for life on Mars, I just imagine the little critter is on the Martian surface instead of my immediate vicinity, and suddenly their value seems evident (fidgets with pockets like Newt Scamander). That said, my nine kids can totally Hadouken and Shoryuken little Nora. I could also help you demonstrate proper form when trashing grocery stores in skates, if you’d like.\\n\\nMark Manson sounds 100% just like me when I have one of my bi-yearly existential crises.  I must confess, the last part of my last message originally said something like “Google already knows everything about me, and I’m just a little speck of cosmic dust on a cool little rock in one of billions of galaxies amidst the infinite vastness of the Universe, so you really can ask me anything.” But I felt it wasn’t flirty enough *nods like Robert Redford in Jeremiah Jones*.\\n\\n*Listens to “The Sims 3 loading screen bopping my head like the Vibing Cat meme* I see it now!\\n\\n*runs faster than Lightning McQueen, passes Sonic the Hedgehog, then The Flash, enters an unknown dimensional veil of juxtaposed timelines, sees you in the distance almost breaking the space-time continuum as you pull out your Tipp-Ex in the past/present/future, pulls out my own bottle of Tipp-Ex to erase the part where you said “Time of death: 17:24”.\\n\\nThat implies that you already do those things and you seem to be functioning well, so I accept your indoctrination process. \\n\\nWhy haven’t you befriended a snail? I can’t say that I have either, but Giant African Snails are almost kinda cute. Nevermind, I just watched a video of a group of them eating some kind of grain but it was sped-up and it was horrifying, do not look that up!\\n\\nAs compelling as that sounds, think about all the HIMYM marathons you’d be missing out on!\\n\\nHmmmmm, I looked up Raven but only found a hotel app, a bank, and  something to stream Netflix together with a party.

I don’t know why I’m sharing this. I wonder if Japan actually does have a kind of earthbound Gundam stashed somewhere to defend itself and it’s not just a meme. I concur on not wanting to meet my heroes.\\n\\nI’m the same way! I may seem like I’m strolling around carefree, but in my head I’ll be making believe (*I’m Making Believe by the Ink Spots and Ella Fitzgerald starts playing*) I must not step on the cracks, or else a landmine will go off. Just kidding. But do you also get a little sad when you're kicking a little stone on the sidewalk and then miss but you have to keep walking?\\n\\n“So I have the deepest form of comprehension for you superstition.“ Anytime I hear the word “superstition”, my mental jukebox plays Superstition by Stevie Wonder.\\n\\nThat whole paragraph sounds like something out of Dirk Gently, that’s really good!  “She has a magnifying glass, probably an entomologist 😂”. \\\"Victorian era-detective-who-has-a-god-complex-and-severely-unhealthy-anger-management-skills-themed disco party!\\\" 😂 \\n\\nOh no! *Conveniently produces a little bottle of eye drops and a handkerchief sealed in an antibacterial bag to rid your eye of said eyelash* \\n\\nYou are very welcome! Yes, that’s a good way to put it. Though you were also right about keeping them somewhere safe. I was listening to some old tracks earlier and I found some that I like more now that some time has passed.\\n\\nAhhh but remember Conan Doyle himself tried that and Sherlock just got Reichenbach’d (this is a me-original verb).

Somehow it made me nostalgic, even though I’d never watched it before.

I applaud you 👏🏻 \\n\\nOh no, I have 0 medical professionals in my family, that I know of. But the usage of \\\"also\\\" makes me want to guess that you do?

I bawled my eyes out at the ending, how did you manage to fight it? \\n\\nI know! They always play the \\\"boring\\\" card. There should be a refugee camp for people being emotionally affected by verbal terrorists stating that vanilla ice-cream is the b-word. \\nYou've never played bingo before?

Was it a stray kitten? Okay so you saved a cricket before, but you bribed one to die during battle? Keeping things in equilibrium are we? \\nOkay, okay, I can't use my inner voice anymore- you save ants??!! I save ants! People think I've completely gone bonkers when I tell them to look where they step. You saved a house gecko? Almost 3 weeks ago a spotted a baby house gecko in my place and Googled if I should put water out for it 😅 I'm happy to report it's still alive and hydrated. \\nAnd exactly the same with mosquitoes! I also warn them, actually talking to them like a madwoman, asking them to leave. \\nI think we have gotten bingo now plenty of times. Time for a clean bingo card. \\n\\nIt doesn't sound insane to me at all. In fact, it's the most sane thing I've heard in a very long time. My argument is very similar. Why is it so easy for people to kill insects but not pets. If a ladybug was the same size as a dog then no one would have killed it (not that anyone kills ladybugs, but you get the point). Just because they are smaller doesn't mean they are insignificant. \\nYes please! That would be very kind of you to teach us how to properly trash grocery stores in skates.\\n\\nTo be honest, I actually thought exactly the same thing- that Mark Manson sounds like you. I have never experienced you experiencing a midlife crisis though, but his writing personality is kind of the same. \\nAnd also, I appreciate you swapping your original Mark Manson- aura, Tony Award worthy paragraph for a more flirty one. \\n\\nYou made it just in time, thank you!

Now I wonder that as well! I low-key want to send the characters from Scooby-Doo to go investigate it, but honestly, what makes me think I have that kind of power? \\n\\nThe black and white image of a guy looking back in agony as his little rock rolls off the sidewalk into the curb inlet with the song \\\"Everybody Hurts\\\" by R.E.M. playing, comes to mind. \\nI can't say that it ever happened to me, but I deeply sympathize with your pain.

One of them is “Choco-Chip & Gumdrops” and I think I need to try that at least once. There’s also Peanut Butter and Pickles, a combination so bizarre I had to do some research. It turns out there’s lots of recipes based around  PB & Pickles, from sandwiches to cookies. I also learned that Hemingway’s favourite sandwich was PB & Onion. *Looks at unfinished manuscript, then back at onion*… “the hardest choices require the strongest wills”. \\n\\nAhhh the ol’ switcheroo! I must’ve misinterpreted the passage you referenced from “Girl, Get Off Your Phone and Learn Some Medicine, You Undereducated Insult to Your Bloodline, Volume 2”. I haven’t read that one. Have you ever watched the movie Airplane? That is both the best and worst movie to watch on a flight.

Cats gonna cat.\\n\\nNooo see that’s the best part, he just jumped off the ring onto a mini trampoline, after which he changed into a suit and tie and a little hat and disappeared into the crowd, we had the whole thing planned.\\n\\nA fellow ant-saviour?! A million times YES!!! Do you also know ant CPR? That’s how I save them when they get caught in the rain and one of the ants looks like it’s drowned but if you swipe it up carefully with the side of your fingertip and blow on it for about 20 seconds, a lot of the time they come back to life! Then you get to watch them dry their antlers with their little hands for about a minute.\\n\\nAww you put water out for the baby gecko, that’s adorable. The one I saved had been stuck on a piece of tape on the ground, can you believe that? After confirming eye movement I quickly googled it and followed a tutorial for how to unstick them. One must never remove them manually, instead, what I did was pour some soybean oil on a little container and I poured a little bit of oil on its body with a teaspoon and made sure it got all around its perimeter by gently poking around him with a Q-tip. After a few minutes of this he was free and ran away on his own, heheh. I give mosquitoes the speech too!! 😂😂 I’m like “look I know you’re just trying to feed your kids, ma’am, but please chill!”\\n\\nI agree. I’ve just found an officially-licensed Harry Potter bingo on Amazon (it’s all pictures so it’s really a Loteria set), I vote we use that next. \\n\\nYessss I know!!! It’s total malarkey.

According to some person on Quora: “So when Akira Toriyama was trying to name his new ‘kame’ (which means ‘turtle’) attack, he couldn’t think of anything. So his wife suggested that he used a reference to help him remember. She suggested the name of Late Hawilian King, ‘Kamehameha’. Toriyama liked her idea enough to keep it. The name would be easier to remember for him if he just thought of the guy he named it after and why he named it that. Thus the ‘Turtle Destruction Wave’ or Kamehameha was born.”\\n\\nI hear you. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. I was just thinking about professional taste testers and I wonder if they can enjoy food or if they’re always critical about it, maybe they even taste the air. Also, think of all the flavours that have been tested in a lab that nobody in modern history except for the taste-testers has ever tasted, like a Mango-Watermelon Croissant or a crunchy chocolate bar called Fake bubblegummy banana, Nutella doughnut and Cashews, Sprinkled with Caramelised Coconut. Just imagine! \\n\\nThat’s an excellent set-up for a short story. I wonder if one would get sued for writing a sci-fi comedy about a guy who’s always smoking the devil’s lettuce investigating his paranoid delusions with his previously-human dog companion who is addicted to the Zaza brownies the other guy bakes (he’s a drug dealer), but then it turns out his newest conspiracy theory was real! They infiltrate an air force facility but it’s completely deserted and nothing happens all day so they break into a hangar because it’s windy out and the guy has dry eye syndrome. So some more time passes, and when they finally give up and are getting ready to go home, they end up fighting over who gets the bigger half of the last brownie, when they bump into a side panel and one of the light fixtures transforms into a drone, which scans the guy like that scene with Gazerbeam in The Incredibles (alternatively, it could also be that the drone produces a keypad and prompts them for a password and the guy just inputs his birthday, which checks out, for reasons that will be revealed later) the hangar starts rumbling and a block of concrete flooring retracts, revealing stairs.

Fluffy bum, funni face, 10/10. I have a book on my Wish List about a wizard and her corgi who is “a seed with unfathomable potential waiting to sprout”. \\n\\n*Gently removes eyelash from your other eye right away but then spends way too long pretending not to find it while saying things like “ahh, almost got it, ok look at me, no no, look into my eyes, yes I see it now”* \\n\\n(No no, I like that) \\n\\nAw shucks, I’m really happy you like the songs! \\n\\nAhhh sorry, Reichenbach refers to Moriarty’s first appearance in the story The Final Problem. Conan Doyle was ready to hang the cape so he sought out in that indescribable literary dimension a character who could bring about the end of Sherlock Holmes, and he found Moriarty. To avoid spoilers, let’s just say that something happens at the Reichenbach Falls which was to be the last time we see Sherlock Holmes. But of course, the people needed more Holmes, so Conan Doyle went back to his writing desk and we got more Holmes. \\nIn other words:\\nReinchenbach’d: adj -  When a literary character comes back to life due to immense popular pressure. \\n\\n*Squints eyes* Raven again, I knew it…\\n\\nYou too?! I stopped watching during S5, but I’ve thought about watching it again a few times. I absolutely love the setup of Holmes and Watson working in a hospital. Sorry I mean House and Wilson.\\n\\nWhaaaat, episode 4 already? *Googles episode* The Fire!!! I love that one. I'm getting Office Withdrawal Syndrome now, I may need to rewatch soon. I’m still on episode 2 of Grey’s Anatomy (path of the tortoise) *presses play after sending this message*. \\n\\nThat whole paragraph had me in stitches! 😂😂 \\n\\n*Tony the Tiger jumps into frame just to say “GRRRRRREAT!”*\\n\\nFour paragraphs ago you said you’d listened to the songs 4 times but now it’s 100 times. If you expect me to believe you listened 96 times in the span of four paragraphs, I believe you, but I must ask your secret, are you wearing the legendary Lightning McQueen Crocs?\\n\\nI’m glad you’re super excited to hear more of them because I’m mega excited to share more of them with you. I spent some time listening to the songs today to see which ones are the easiest to “sing”, I think I’ve narrowed it down enough. Now, acoustic pop or synth-pop? Oh, also, I need to pick an “artist name” and I can’t seem to decide, most of my nominees are combinations of book characters 😂.\\n\\n I also like the name Rigel, it’s the name of a star that shines 50,000 times brighter than the Sun *megalomania intensifies*. It’s also the name of a cousin of mine whom I’ve only met three times, but my first impression of him was him being scared to climb up to dive from the second(?) level of a diving platform until suddenly something changed in his eye and he started laughing and then he climbed all the way to the top, ran across the platform and jumped while shouting “GREGORIAAA!!!” at the top of his lungs. And that is such a funny scene to me. I don’t even know who Gregoria was, I don’t know why I’m sharing this (Ah-haaa! *snaps fingers, winks, does finger guns*). Google says Rigel also means “foot” though, so who knows. Decisions, decisions…\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-10-06T04:16:32.393Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sender\": \"Karla\",\n    \"text\": \"Ah damn!

Now I want to have a LOTR marathon and eat pizza with a turtle (while covering my whole body with Despicable Me plasters, of course)\\nWho said dogs are the top animal companions? \\nAlso, last night I dreamt about a tortoise, and I think your whole paragraph about the Path of the Snapping Turtle had something to do with it. \\n\\n\\\"Peanut Butter and Pickles\\\" sounds like the name of a Cartoon Network show. \\nReading your text as a woman who doesn't even put two different foods on her fork. There's something about Hemingway eating Peanut Butter and Onions sandwiches that feels like it shouldn't be such a surprise. Like we all already knew it, but we weren't aware that we already knew. \\n\\nI definitely got into character of someone whose family are all doctors though, so no misinterpretation on your part. \\nI haven't watched Airplane, but I have watched Snakes on a Plane. And Disney's \\\"Planes\\\". Also, Manifest (which is about an airplane that mysteriously crashed, Flight 828, and even more mysterious events happened after the crash. Would also definitely be one of my top favourite shows. Great acting by Parveen Kaur)\\nThe cover of \\\"Airplane!\\\" looks great though, almost like a Salvador Dali painting, if it is the 1980's comedy/drama you are referring to with Leslie Nielsen.\\n\\nYou have to take Dramamine when flying? You get motion sickness? That's a coincidence, I don't get it when I fly, but whenever I use an elevator, I am severely off balance when I get out. I also easily get car sick. \\n\\nLa Loteria's pictures gives such an eclectic-retro vibe. Like something you should only be playing with a margarita in your hand. I've obviously never played it before, but now it will be added to my bucket list. Also, I saw the picture of the guy carrying the globe and I'm all about finding out what that means. \\n\\nThat \\\"ooaawwwrgghh\\\" painted the picture of baby dinosaur in my head. You even made him a little cot and he still abandoned you? That is so typical. Cats be making psychologists rich. No wonder so many people have abandonment issues. See, dogs would never do that. Dogs just invade your personal space and exhaust all your energy. They be driving you to a cardiologist with all the RedBull's you need to drink.\\n\\nOoohhhh so the cricket never had to die? That is great news! I kinda thought maybe that was the case, but then a small part of me still thought maybe he committed suicide when jumping off the ring. And then I remembered his family accepted 10 bushels of alfalfa, which made me think, \\\"Damn, 10 bushels of lucerne is enough to replace your son?\\\" then I viewed it from another perspective and thought maybe the cricket was a terrible son and just goes against every cricket morale. I have never psychoanalysed the morality of a cricket family so much in my life. But it has made me a stronger person today. \\nAlso, the cricket wearing a suit and tie and hat probably changed the way the planets align. The image of that just makes every cricket jumping from a ring onto a mini trampoline and not wearing a suit and tie and little hat, feel sinister. \\n\\nThat is the cutest thing ever! I always blow on them when they get wet, but never knew that was, indeed, proper procedure! I guess saving ants just comes naturally to me *chuckles in a smug way but starts choking on a cough*\\nThe mental image of them drying their little antlers made me wish they were dog-sized so that I can have an ant as a pet. But then I remembered what their mouths look like and I immediately lit 21 candles, sprayed the walls with a mixture of lavender- and peppermint essential oil and burned 3 strands of hair and a piece of paper with my name written in Greek, to keep the night terrors at bay. \\n\\nWow, you would do great in a white coat. You can definitely scrub in, doctor. \\nAaahhh, soybean oil, of course! *takes notes* \\nFrom now on I shall go nowhere without a small bottle of soybean oil and a few Q-tips.

It has dishes like Neville Longbottom's Toad in a Hole and Bubble and Squeak. Nora would love that! You and your 9 kids want to join us for Christmas this year? We can even try to make the Chocolate Frogs and Fizzing Whizzbees! And decorate the Christmas tree with wizard wands, owls, and letters (the ones that came flying in through the fireplace in Philosopher's Stone). \\n\\nOh when you said, \\\"malarkey\\\" it made me think of Kate Mularkey in Firefly Lane which is played by Stella from himym, and Izzie from Grey's Anatomy as her best friend. \\\"I don't know why I'm sharing this.\\\"\\n\\n*Balistically screams, \\\"Witch, witch!\\\" and points to a nearby forest to redirect the pitchfork-wielding townfolks away from you* \\n\\n*Stands up to clap hands, looks around the room and gives everyone the \\\"I know that guy\\\" look*\\n\\nOh because I wanted to ask, \\\"If you pet their humans, can I visit you in prison?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean yeah last time I did end up $500k in debt in Vegas with the mob after my third fake alias, but really who hasn't been there?\\\" 😂\\n\\nI always knew this was a simulation. I once almost got crushed on a motorcycle by a truck pushing me into a car on my right-hand side. When I fell off the bike, I very robotically, and lady-like, got up and stood with my hands clasped in front of me the same way cooks stood while waiting for royalty to finish eating their dinner, while waiting for the driver to stand up. Even I was amazed at my own sim-like movement. The driver was in shock and kept asking me if I got hurt, but I acted like it was just a normal Tuesday and that was just part of the routine, like brushing teeth in the morning. \\nWith that being said, in my next science class, I will teach my students that our \\\"god\\\" is called LoremlpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdlipiscingElit, and that he has a mom and likes to eat dinner. \\nAlso, I am extremely confused as to why LoremlpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdlipiscingElit hasn't used the \\\"motherlode\\\" cheat yet. \\n\\nVery true, I'm convinced even seeing butterflies drinking nectar from flowers in a zoomed-in, sped-up video would be terrifying. \\n*lurks around the corner to see if all the night terror candles are still burning* \\n\\n\\nNooo I haven't seen that 😅 the kid was smart!

So, going with that logic- yes, yes I have. \\nThat's a great idea actually! Or every now and then just replace one \\\"meow\\\" with another word and as a collective it will form one sentence that has some profound meaning, like, \\\"Switch to Royal Canin\\\" or something like that. \\n\\nOh wow, way to go Akira's wife! (Also, adding Tabitha'ed, along with Reichenbach'd, to our list of newly found verbs, still waiting on Oxford' reply, I think they are playing hard to get) \\nI had no idea what a turtle had to do with anything so I had to Google again, and found out they went to Turtle School.

In the room was a slab of rock with carvings that read “Meow meow meow. Below the tablet was a rock the size of what would eventually be known as a bowling ball and a carving of a cat’s paw. So the cat put his paw on the pawprint and it fit purrfectly, so he pressed it. This made the bricks in the little room shift around for a while. Eventually, the side entrance opened again and the cat came out to a new room, it was a spacious dome-like structure made of something that had the texture of cartilage and looked  obsidian, but perhaps that was because there was no lighting. There was a voice that said “Meow meow meow, meow?”, and the cat said “Meow meow meow”, then the voice said “Meow, meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.

And I haven't thought about that movie in a LONG time. I have actually forgotten all about it. *insert literally any YouTube video about synchronicity* \\nSpeaking of which, have you ever experienced seeing certain patterns repeat itself in a weird way? I remember more or less six or seven years ago, I was playing with a normal card deck and just for fun as all the cards were lying faced down, I told myself that something specific would happen if the card I pick is for example 8 of spades, I did this with 3 cards and strangely enough guessed all the cards correctly and the next day all 3 things that I said would happen if I guess the card correctly, did happen. \\nI don't believe in Tarrot cards or any weird voodoo stuff by the way 😂 that's just something strange that happened once. You ever experienced something like that? No? Just me then? I should what? I should go see a psychiatrist? Okay then.\\nI could have sworn I heard about Everything Everywhere All at Once before but when I Googled it just now, it didn't seem familiar at all. \\nI also looked up The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy and saw the strangest looking alien probably ever used in film.

I feel like Alfred found his gang. What will you do if he decides to stay there? \\n\\nI don't mind crying like a baby for La La Land. I have no idea what it's about, besides that it's a musical (?). And I have some suspicion that the \\\"La La\\\" refers to sleep, which might mean death or something. Who knows. Oh, you know, that's who knows. I'll watch it tomorrow or maybe even after sending this message if I can stay awake that long. \\n\\nWhen you mentioned the Patronus, I realised how little of Harry Potter I can actually remember. I completely forgot everything about Remus Lupin by the way. And I can't remember the ending at all. I think there was a bridge involved and I think Neville played an important part at the end, but I don't know what it was. I seriously don't even deserve to call myself a fan until I have rewatched everything. \\n\\nI’m glad we both agree that quokkas smile! If you had said they don’t, I might have dreamt that you were being rude to me again tonight, and I have no idea how you would have topped the Japanese apology and comically large rose this time. \\n\\n\\\"*sniffs the air loudly*.

Then they ask her if she’s going to “come back next year and do it again to reclaim your title?” And she says “I think I will, yeah, hehe!”.

Hmm…\\n\\n\\n\\n(If you completed the “hmm” above with “decisions, decisions” you get a cookie).\\n\\n*Patrick bloodshot eyes meme* 😂😂😂 that's perfect.\\n\\nThat sounds like the best doctor’s appointment ever.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can tell you, but I’d have to spoil the whole story. Ok, spoilers coming in three, two one (if you do not wish to read spoilers, skip to next paragraph, where it says ——SAFE ZONE): So, their Time Machine can only send messages to the past because there’s a ”glitch” in the machine (which consists of two containers. One is the “input” container, where they put something, the other is the “output” container, where the thing comes out) I don’t think they ever explain how they figured out the space part of space-time manipulation, but anyway, it turns out that the thing they send arrives before they send it, creating two of the same at the same time. Of course, most movies teach us that such an event simply cannot be. So, the original thing they send disappears after the “copy” is received. They figure this is because there’s many dimensions, and they’re just taking one copy from some other dimension very briefly. They keep running tests with the machine and eventually they receive a copy that comes from the future. So that’s how they know they’re able to send messages to their past selves. I am realising this is a little complicated to explain succinctly, but to make a long story short, wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey stuff happens and suddenly the book shifts characters mid-conversation and without warning. It turns out one of those times they activated the machine, their future selves didn’t get their past-past selves to do things differently, and thus the entire timeline up until that future point has been re-written. That’s kind of where the story falls apart though, because one of the characters is like “yeah, it seems that I’m happy in that timeline, so let’s all commit seppuku and destroy our timeline so that they live instead” and everyone’s just like “yeah, that makes sense, gg everybody”. They way they plan to do that is by sending their past selves a message that says “if [X condition] is true, keep sending this to the past, otherwise, stop the experiment right now”. \\n\\n——SAFE ZONE\\n\\nNow I’m a little scared to ask what the three guesses were. Just kidding. I did something similar one time at a church camp thing, they were doing a giveaway and I said to my brother I was going to win it because I knew a secret spell. My secret spell was realising that, out of the 50+ people there,  only 6 of us were new. If they rigged the draw so that the prize would go to one of the new kids, which I figured they probably would, then between the both of us we had a roughly one-in-three chance of winning, very good odds. I scribbled a random doodle on my ticket (it was probably a smiley face) and acted totally confident like I had it in the bag. My ticket won. He was losing his mind. For years he’d tell the story and he never believed me when I said I just drew a random doodle on it 😂.\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe in Tarrot cards or any weird voodoo stuff by the way 😂\\\" \\n\\n[*Awooga awooga copy pasta*, to save you a Google search:\\n\\n\\\"jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets, heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair\\\" ].

Throws phone at wall, phone bounces from wall and hits the kid with face glued to table against the head and knocks them to the floor. Stomps back to teaching area, accidentally pushing kid that had just gotten up from the floor, back down again. Blames kids for not knowing more about Genetics. Continues with lesson, hears notification on phone, accidentally cuts off a kid’s ponytail as I jump from chair, sprints to desk, sees your name on the notification panel, starts to hyperventilate, get’s motion sickness, asteroid about to hit Earth, my arm stretches into the sky and catches the asteroid, saying, “Not today, buddy” and throws it back into the sky.

Then we were talking about some space thing, but in typical dream fashion, I was now a disembodied view soaring over highways at great speed whilst we talked.\\n] \\n\\nSee, I go back and forth on the idea of assigning mild, cute-looking manual labour to animals. On the one hand, I just want them to roam around doing their stuff. On the other hand, I feel like I’d get bored doing nothing all day. I saw a video of a Labrador picking oranges once. The doggo was carrying a basket in his mouth (the camera was in the basket), then he’d set it down and pick an orange, drop the orange in the basket, and continue. I felt like he was enjoying completing the task, maybe he felt a sense of responsibility. Plus, you could rotate them for 1 hour shifts per day, maybe even get them organised in teams, give them pizza as incentive, then you could give them ID’s and make them swipe in at 7:00 sharp, monitor their productivity, give them uniforms… FREE! *Stonks meme* (That whole paragraph is satire, but I feel slightly bad about using hypothetical animals for hypothetical labour). \\n\\nIs it a crime that I haven’t seen “You’ve got mail”? Now that I’ve seen the cover of it, I remember staring at the VHS one time, that’s all I know about it.  \\n\\n*runs to remove baseball bat from the campfire while chewing on a roasted marshmallow* 😂 I haven’t been around a campfire or had a roasted marshmallow in soooo long. I think that’s the secret to any good spooky coming-of-age tale that takes place during a school trip. Bonus points if the scene is set on the beach or near a quarry. \\n\\nDepends on if by “cute” you mean absolutely the most boss-looking toddler ever. In that case, (I don’t want to ruin you, but) yes, I was very cute as a kid. I’ll see if I have any pictures on my hard drive and send you one (some guy in my mind wearing a safety vest yelling words like “Zuck” and “A.I.” and “identity theft is not a joke, Jim”). \\n\\n*brain does a backflip and breaks neck, again* 😂\\n\\nThe Old Photo Album (yes, I’m picturing it as a “quest item” in a videogame) feels like a “Chekhov’s Gun”, I’m sure it’ll come into play in later seasons when everyone’s forgotten about it. (Rings mum to ask if she still has the albums).\\n\\nOk, in my defence, baseball is pretty popular here and there’s a stadium in town. Also, one of those games I counted may or may not have been my little cousin’s kiddie league game. \\n\\n“*claps hands in playful manner, knowing she will receive a cookie*” \\n*looks up at the sky.

He’s diving head-first in a strange reflective suit, wearing a helmet with what looks like a sticker of a couch stamped on it.*\\n\\nI take off my first pair of sunglasses and hand them to you, we stare at the man diving in our general direction *General Direction 🫡*.\\n\\nThe man does a somersault in the air and produces a helix from his helmet just like Inspector Gadget. At the same time, wings come out of his suit, they look just like Buzz Lightyear’s. He starts to decelerate rapidly.\\nThe man lands in front of us and hands me a small round pearlescent container. The man turns and starts to sprint away in a funny way, we stand there looking at him until he disappears from view. \\nWe look down at the container.\\nI hand you the container.\\nIt immediately detects your fingerprint and opens from the middle. Inside the container is a heart-shaped Ferrero-Rocher cookie.\\n\\nUgh, spoilers. I hate when that happens! That’s why I don’t look up things I’m reading/watching anymore, or at least I try to, just for Google to track me down across the internet and follow me around with a torch and a book full of spoilers, waiting for me to slow down so it can recommend me some search result that’ll reveal a massive spoiler as the top comment on some obscure website that isn’t even remotely related to the thing.\\n\\n(Did you really draw the pictures of what was happening with the time machine as you read 😂).\\n\\nI agree, the story feels like a thought experiment where the author thought “maybe I should publish this” and his agent went with it.

We run back to the top. On \\\"say cheese!\\\" we both slide down the cheese slide and instantly regret it as we reach the bottom. We are 90% covered in cheese.

Ah, darn, your dream sounds just perfect with the science conversation and us chilling on the couch, and you even typed it when you woke up before you forgot it. So sweet! *Googles how long it will take scientists to finally create mobile portals*\\n\\nI imagined you as Peter Pan’s shadow from the show Once Upon A Time in the part where you soared over highways. But more of a friendly, dark blue version as opposed to the demonic-looking black version. (“I don’t know why I’m sharing this”)\\n\\n I can see how the dog actually enjoyed picking lemons. And I was all like “Aww that’s so cute, imagine a dog showing up at your front door with a basket of fruit in his mouth,” then I had this whole cottagecore aesthetic in my mind with a cabin in the countryside with ducks and dogs and everyone kind of works together in perfect harmony, in a cute way, the ducks remove the laundry from the laundry line and the dogs do gardening, the horses happily mow the lawn, etc., until you mentioned “Plus, you could rotate them for 1 hour shifts per day, maybe even get them organized in teams, give them pizza as incentives…” Suddenly the image of the gardening the dogs had to do changed into a field of landmines that they had to deactivate, the image of the horses mowing the lawn turned into an image of horses having to pull monster trucks across the field and then the whole fantasy was ruined.\\n\\n“…make them swipe in at 7:00 sharp…” 😂\\n\\n(That whole paragraph is satire, but I feel slightly bad about using hypothetical animals for hypothetical labour) 🥺😂\\n\\nGood question! Let me take a brief moment to think about that.\\n\\n*brief moment later*\\n\\nOkay, I have come to the following conclusion:\\nI would have expected you to not have watched other romantic films like The Notebook, Me Before You, Titanic, Remember Me, etc. But since you are a writer and an avid reader, I would have expected you to have watched You’ve Got Mail (for the bookstore and the writing elements), 50 First Dates (for the fact that Adam Sandler plays in it and you have a sense of humour), About Time (for the time-travelling element), Notting Hill (for the bookstore element, and the great humour by Rhys Ifans). So, to answer your question- yes, it is a crime, but one that is easy to forgive.\\n\\nMe too! *adds to bucket list “MUST have campfire on beach or near a quarry with Alberto while roasting marshmallows and telling spooky coming-of-age tales, even if just in a dream*\\n\\nAhhhhhh! *proceeds to be ruined*\\n“(some guy in my mind wearing a safety vest yelling words like ‘Zuck’ and ‘A.I.’ and ‘identity theft is not a joke, Jim’)” 😂\\nI tried so hard to picture you “boss-looking” but all I kept imagining is this little kid in a baseball uniform, holding a bat that is three times his size with these tiny hands and a baseball cap that is for some reason too big so it covers half his face (for some reason oversized clothes on kids are cute, apparently), basically the male version of Agnes (yes, yes, I know I have mentioned her before but she is simply adorable).\\n\\n*nods head in approval for counting cousin’s kiddie league game*\\n\\n“Diplomats around the world start making a bunch of phone calls” 😂\\n\\n*General Direction” 🫡\\n\\nThe dramatic story for just a cookie 😂 And the cookie being a heart- shaped Ferrero-Rocher cookie 🫠\\n\\n(By the way, speaking of Buzz Lightyear, have you watched the movie Lightyear?)\\n*She happily accepts the cookie, breaks it into 2 halves and hands him the bigger half.

His character radiates charm and wit, perfectly complementing the narrative’s needs. The evocative green-blue and brown colour palette beautifully captures the film's nostalgic spirit, enhancing the sense of adventure and the yearning for your grandmother’s famous apple pie.

I have taken over 500 screenshots of him from this film and stuck it to my wall.

After I finished reading the first section, “The Theory of the Un-provable”, I almost regretted getting the book and making you get it too. That part just bored me into a vegetative state, but the rest started to get interesting. And exactly as you say, just as it started to get interesting, the chapter ended. I was just as curious about the glowing raccoon. And the fact that Kary Mullis passed away literally just one year before he could see how his invention came into play with Covid, is actually kind of sad.

Thank you, I’m very happy to hear you enjoyed our little montage. “Well, maybe you are?” Hmmm, I’m not sure, am I? One time at school we had a team assignment for Literature class, it was one of those “filler episode” projects, due two days later or so, likely a Friday \\n\\n(*closes book* “hey, do teachers usually give easy assignments that are due Friday so that they have less to grade over the weekend?” *you slowly lift your head in a way that signals imminent violence* *opens book way too close to his face* ). The assignment was to perform a short comedy sketch.\\n\\nI went home that day and downloaded a free trial or free version of CeltX screenwriting software, and wrote ours. My team was me and three friends, and I had them all print out the script. It was about superheroes (big surprise). The teacher had me stay after class, she said she’d talk to the headmistress to let her change the syllabus, she wanted me to write a big play for the whole class. ***I extended my arms in a pose like what pops up when you search for “Tony Stark entrance scene” on Google Images***; and said I would. It was a lot of fun getting to play writer/director/actor/casting director/art director/producer of a highly illegal theatre play starring Marvel characters (I played Spider-Man, of course). Before writing the play I talked to everybody in my class extensively about different character options I thought would work for them that could fit into the story. I had a binder with lots of info, and everybody picked their own character and were happy with their choices. My teacher convinced the headmaster and we staged the play in the main auditorium. \\nI was very surprised when I finally saw everyone in costume the day of the play (we only rehearsed in normal clothes), I thought they’d phone it in but a few people looked they were secretly really into Comic-Con. That is my only playwriting experience with actual people. After that, I kept writing movie scripts for a few years, but I stopped because I didn’t see any way that I could sell my scripts (also, music took up all of my free time). Also, “Mr. Blue Sky” gives a momentary +10 boost to the “Writer of Happy Scenes” perk, it’s true.\\n\\n***sentences wrapped in this symbol may be completely apocryphal and added for dramatisation purposes.\\n\\nSeeing my name next to yours made me all giddy inside.

This results in an inability to lean on railings and ride the escalators on those humongous multi-storey shopping centres (we’re talking the third floor ones that are like a mile long), also, crippling anxiety in very tall buildings with floor-to-ceiling windows (which makes my Big Bang Theory dream even funnier). Ok yeah I’m scared of heights. How did you know? Nevermind, you always know. I’m convinced that if I had a jetpack, it would go away (the fear of heights, not the jetpack). I once thought I’d casually lose my fear of heights by experiencing the view from the once-tallest building in the world, all or nothing. I pressed the elevator button, I waited, a few minutes passed. I took that as a sign from the Universe. Some fears are there to save you. Strangely, I am totally ok on flights, not even fazed. Though I must confess, I wish I hadn’t heard the news about Boeing duct-taping turbines to fuselage.

I played way too long every day for most of my life, which was a horrible idea. When I was in uni I went to the doctor and he was like “you got tendinosis, GG”, which made me drop all instruments for about a year after changing majors (I was originally in the world’s strangest mixed program, electrical engineering / music production, where I must proudly mention, my class quickly nicknamed me *read in a comical tone* “the prodigy” 😂). I went to therapy for that and I’m totally fine now in daily life, but I have some residual damage that flares up if I overwork my tendons by asking them to play technically-demanding pieces like “Recuerdos de la Alhambra” or the 3rd movement of “La Catedral” 😅. This pains me deeply and I greatly miss playing at that level, especially since I have the muscle memory, it’s like being hungry and having a packed lunch locked in a cell that’s welded shut *drama intensifies*.

Yeah, I got that feeling. It’s very strange to me being afraid of heights now because as kids, my brother and I used to climb to the very top of trees where the branches got too thin to step on. And my dad used to take us on this hiking route, and part of the route included a kind of thick water pipe that stretched over a stream, but the pipe was a “break every bone in your body” distance above the stream, and we used to cross the stream by walking on that water pipe with my dad behind us in case we slipped.

Serotonin and Dopamine levels increase significantly.*\\n\\nAre you sure I can spoil it??!! Thank you, I love to spoil plots!! Okay so the next paragraph consist of absolute life-ruining spoilers:\\n\\nIn the show, one characters plays the role of both Rumpelstiltskin and Beast. So, Belle fell in love with Beast, who is also Rumpelstiltskin. Later in the show you find out that Peter Pan is his father. Princess Odette from The Swan Princess (in the show her name is Emma Swan), is the main character who is responsible for breaking the curse that The Evil Queen casted that sent everyone to our realm, particularly to a town called Storybrooke, which made them forget about their fairytale identities and lives before they were sent to our realm. The Evil Queen and Robin Hood fell in love. Cinderella almost shot her stepsister with a flintlock pistol. Red Riding Hood turned out to also be the wolf and ate her boyfriend right before they almost eloped. Snow White and Prince Charming turned out to be Swan’s parents.\\n\\nWhen the characters lived in their own realm, right before The Evil Queen casted the spell and cursed them to our realm, Geppetto build a magical wardrobe that served as a portal for Snow White and Prince Charming to put Swan in (who was a baby at that time). Swan was prophesied to be the saviour who would, on her 27th birthday, break the curse. Geppetto lied and told everyone that the wardrobe can only take one person, although it was bale to send two people to our realm. (They would be sent somewhere else, not to Storybrooke with the rest of the characters, so they would have memory of their lives, but obviously as Emma Swan was just a baby when this happened, she had no memory of her parents or anyone in the magical realm. She was placed in foster care in our realm.) Geppetto sent his son, Pinocchio, with Emma to our realm in the wardrobe and made him promise to take care of her. Pinocchio was just a little boy at that time, and when they arrived in our realm, he broke his promise to take care of her (hence Emma being in foster care). As a result of him breaking his promise, he slowly started to turn back to wood again.\\n\\nOkay this is all I am going to spoil for you. You have absolutely no idea how happy I was while typing all of this. I was super obsessed with that show at some point.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n Your watchlist consist of mainly things I recommended 🥺\\n\\nYou haven’t watched Deadpool yet. Not that you need it, but I give you full permission to move Deadpool to the top of your list.\\n\\nYou composed piano pieces when you were just six years old?! Your parents must have been the proudest parents in the world. *Googles tendinosis, sees the treatment options include “rest”. Orders piano*\\n\\nNo, seriously it sounds terrible how it affects you now. Having all that talent but being limited and unable to express it to the extend that you know you can. It seems like piano has been such a big part of your life and having to drop all instruments for a year must have been really hard. At that point, did you think that you won’t really play music anymore or did you know it was just temporarily to take a break from it? So you were originally in a mixed program of electrical engineering / music production and then you had to change majors to focus mainly on electrical engineering?

I thought of it as a temporary thing, which I’m glad was the case. “and then you had to change majors to focus mainly on electrical engineering?” Not quite, the programme was a joint package so I couldn’t still have the EE part without the Music Production. I also kind of didn’t want to be only an engineer (quick context: my father was a gifted painter when he was young, but then went to uni and joined the dark side. A couple of times he said that if I went the same route as him, he would’d failed as a father, so I kind of wanted to have some other title 😅). I went with a combined major of “Interaction Design” (UX & programming) and animation (for movies & TV/film), another curveball 😂. I ended up focusing on the programming aspect, then I started to sell my code online, this was still a rather niche activity at the time, so there was a market for it. I shifted more and more to other web businesses and after a while I had a *YT: “Cat Transcendence -limitless”* moment where I decided I was Wozniak 2.0 and should just focus on that and switch my major to the mostly-online configuration, but then I went one step further and decided to study ”Languages” (this was the one I’d decided would take up the least amount of mental energy), studies which I have never in my life used 😅.

Moving things with your mind? You might say. Like, books and stuff? The skilled debater will then pull out the Encyclopedia Galactica and suddenly become a world-renowned physicist with a specialisation in energy, and if you can move energy, you can move anything. \\nc) Teleportation: The movie Jumper. We all watched it. Pretty cool.\\n\\n“You have your fork tightly clasped in your fist and never break eye-contact with him. When I'm not looking, the goose gives you a sadistical look. I pat the goose on his head and says something like, \\\"You're such a good boy\\\". Your jaw drops. Your face turns red and smoke comes from your ears. You slam your fist with the fork on the dining table.” I watched this unfold vividly in my mind’s eye 😂😂.\\n\\n\\\"Fast forward to you sleeping on the couch and the goose and I sleeping in the bed\\\" 😭 that’s brutal! \\n\\n*Scene opens with a view of the back of the couch. My head slides up into frame. I have a Maori face tattoo and am wearing a goose costume. “Kweeek kweeek, @#$%&” I say. I have hired the National Geographic crew to film the encounter, but what they capture instead is the goose sneaking out of the bedroom and STEALING from your purse, that’s right (the purse is in the lounge, I didn’t let them record the bedroom). He thinks he’s gonna get away with it too, but what the goose doesn’t know is that I saw that coming and replaced the bills in your wallet with counterfeits from the kingdom of GooGooGeese that all have individual AirTags from Temu taped on them. The next morning, the King himself, King Goose XXVII, comes by to get the goose. It turns out the blue-ribbon-wearing goose is royalty, but also a kleptomaniac, and they had finally gotten him the help he needed, but he escaped. He returns with his family and gets reformed, they all live happily ever after and I get to sleep in the bed again.  \\n\\n“Also, I too, believe that this could be a world where all the stars align and life goes our way.” 🥺🥺🥹 \\n\\n“*chuckles nervously with the hope that it's enough to do total damage control*” 😂\\n\\nYes that IMDB review was glorious!

You could write a three-sentence reply and I’d be happy). \\n\\n“But of course I want to know how many words we have exchanged!” Your wish is my command. You were pretty spot-on in your estimation of it being about half a novel, depending on the metric you use for comparison. \\n\\nWe have exchanged somewhere between 58,866 and 58,230 words (the number has changed since last night, and as I’m writing this). I’m gonna go with 58,548. If we account for a completely-made-up rate of quoted messages of 5%, we’ve traded approximately 55,620 words so far. According to the internet, Carrie is between 60,581 and 60,718 words long, I’m guessing depending on the edition. The “average” word count for “adult fiction”, according to Google, ranges from 70,000 to 120,000 words, while for YA novels, the range is 50,000 to 70,000. \\n\\nHmmmmmmm, that’s a very good question. I think I would definitely need a few more details than that, but if they had all the music, literature and movies from Earth, unlimited musical instruments, recording studios, nature, cute animals and everyone I care about could join me, I would definitely put it up for a vote.

Also, Jimmy's hair looks like a KFC soft serve, but brown. \\n\\n\\\"There was definitely foliage\\\" 😂 I wouldn't have suspected otherwise. By the way, don't you just love the smell of earth after rain? And freshly cut grass? Also, important question- do you like cinnamom? Both smell and taste. \\n\\nI think that's great because the chances that I heard it before are very low, so although I might need to Google your references, I think that's part of the reason I find them so darn funny. To me it's all new. \\nOh wow you weren't kidding when you said you haven't watched much TV lately 😅\\nSpeaking of new stuff, apparently there's a show or cartoon or whatever (I don't even want to Google it, too disappointed) called TV Boy or TV Head or something, not sure, (yet again, I refuse to Google it) about a boy with a TV head. And from the description of the show and all the slang and phrases that came from it, I have lost like 80% faith in humanity. As I got older I finally started to understand why our parents always complained about how much things have changed and how our music/movies suck to them. I don't think everything today sucks though, but I fully understand the struggle to adapt to something so completely different from what you grew up with. I am therefore not the biggest advocate for the era we live in. \\n(The Darwin quote \\\"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change,\\\" comes to mind and I realize I am fine with going extinct 😂)\\nAlso, my answer to the volunteering to live on another planet might have just now in this specific moment changed for all the above reasons. I used to think that I would easily volunteer for something like that. It would be new and exciting and you'd get to experience something a very high statistic of humans never will. \\nBut I think it would take an extremely long time for it to start feeling like home, and I would just be in a constant longing for Earth. My mind would eventually start telling me that the war and crime and everything negative here were not actually that bad and I would probably struggle to connect to the new planet. Also, I can see how that can be psychoanalysed in a certain way, and I can with absolute certainty say that it is not connected to anything else. \\n\\nI like how you chose The Flash to save everybody. So selfless of you. You really put a lot of thought into the telekinesis one. The part where you said \\\"and if you can move energy, you can move anything\\\" gave me power hungry villian vibes 😂 also just joking. I highly doubt that you are able to be a villian. Also, all of this made me think of Megamind for some reason. And now I'm thinking of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. And now I will shut up. \\nOh wait, I have one last thing to add. When you said that boys usually ask that question to each other a lot, I tried to think of a question that usually repeats in female conversations and realized that it's almost always, \\\"If you were a single mother and couldn't find a job and had no family or friends and had to fend for your baby, would you become a stripper?\\\" 😂\\n\\n\\\"😭 that's brutal\\\" I take it back!!! I didn't mean it! I was just tired. I was on drugs. I was drunk. I was hypnotised. I was gun-pointed. I took an oath. I was possessed. The porcelain doll stared at me. I was out of coffee. The dog ate my homework. \\n*mental image of me sneaking out of the room, leaving the duck alone in bed, and slipping under the blanket next to you on the couch*\\n\\n*starts reading your story* \\nThe image of your Maori tattooed face sliding up into frame 😂😂 I would have never thought of anything like that if you hadn't mentioned it. Probably ever. \\n\\\"Kweeek kweeek, @#$%&\\\" 😂\\nHow could the goose have betrayed me like that? 😢\\nAlso a very smart move of you for not letting them record the bedroom. I also appreciate the reappearance of the Temu AirTags. I am happy the goose got the help he needed, I wish him the best. There was a period in my life where I sincerely thought the goose and I had a connection, but I guess it's typical goose behaviour to dissapoint. No hard feelings. I'm just glad we are back in the same bed again, say what you want but geese are not the best cuddlers. So, forgive and forget? \\n\\n\\\"You could write a three-sentence reply and I'd be happy\\\" 🥺\\nOh my gosh we really could have written half a darn novel! In less than a month! Why aren't we best-selling authors yet? Procrastination for me. And you are already a prodigy so oh what the hell. \\n\\nOkay, so let's say hypothetically that no, they didn't have any literature or musical instruments or anything like that from Earth and you would be going with an X amount of strangers. It is purely for the experience of living on another planet, forever. But the planet has lots of foliage and other types of cute animal species. And you would be communicating with NASA about your discoveries on the new planet, which would occasionally be broadcasted so everyone would know about the volunteers and you'd be an important part of history.Would you still want to go? \\n\\nExactly the same for me 😂 I never watched a whole season from start to end. I just remember my brother and his friends watching it and I would occasionally pop in and watch a part of it with them and then leave to play Chicken Invaders on the PC 😂 but I never left during the theme song. It was an unspoken rule I made for myself to stay for the whole duration of that. \\n\\n\\\"*runs at super-speed, trips on pebble, breaks toe*\\\" 😂😂\\n*Gently puts a Despicable Me plaster on your toe.

He was severely depressed so I took care of him. Every time I put him down, the mom would bite him. That was very sad. And in the same dream there was a part where my dad wanted to buy apples (remember how I mentioned that you mentioned Granny Smith apples?) but the guy we usually bought them from wasn't there. The next morning there were 2 gigantic bags of green apples on the car seats but no one knew where they came from. Then I thought the guy came to deliver the apples and took our puppies as a trade. That was even more sad, but then I saw the puppies playing somewhere and I felt better. \\n\\nI had another dream in which I had a horse.

I was trained from a young age in the art of pottery by a travelling merchant . He was famous by name when he was young, but nobody believed he was who he said now, so one day he told me to put on a fake beard and he acted like I was him and that he recognised me, and somehow people believed him, so we started selling our vases. Eventually people wanted more vases than we could make, so we started smuggling knockoff of our own designs. One day, the po-po came a knockin’ and the merchant and me had to evade them in an epic motorbike chase. There were two small boats waiting for us in the water on the pier, and coincidentally there was a lady selling fruit with two ramps that lined up perfectly with the boats, so we each looked at each other one last time and jumped off the ramps, letting our Vespas drop into the water. The people on the boat took me in as their own and named me Alberto. Hmmmm, that's a great point. I've been told a story that I think is greatly exaggerated, but if one is to believe the tale, one day when I was just chilling in the womb 👶 I was restless and they played Beethoven and I calmed down, and apparently when Beethoven stopped I would start kicking again. Like I said, I don't know that it's true. That said, Beethoven has always been my favourite and I was only told the story when I was grown. My mother is much more of a Rachmaninoff man than the mighty Ludwig Van, and my father was more of a Bach and Mozart type of guy. For me, it's always been Beethoven.\\n\\n*pulls out Bingo card* 😂. That’s really cool! Does that mean you like the visual arts? Do you have a favourite painter or favourite paintings? Mine are the most cliché: Vermeer(very close second place tied between Rembrandt and Hopper) and \\\"Het melksmeisje\\\" respectively. \\n\\nOh I didn’t finish all of that, I kept switching. Languages was just the most “hands-free” one 😅 that allowed me to work on other things at the same time. \\n\\n“I studied Financial Management” 🏆. Ok, you don’t know how nice it is to hear that. Not that you studied that specifically, but just that you have a financial education (a massive understatement in this case). Obviously not to the same extent, but I’ve been mildly interested in finance from a distance ever since I was like thirteen when I was at the supermarket and thought to ask some random question when reading some food packaging, it went something like:\\n“why does this Sam’s Club packaging say Walmart Group?”\\n“Walmart owns Sam’s”\\n“Who owns Walmart?\\\"\\n“The shareholders”\\n“What’s a sha-”\\n*Camera cuts to reading “finance for dummies”* 😂.\\nI loved learning about things like that. My parents were adamant about me keeping track of my own expenses since I was a toddler, so finding out there was a world out there where this was normalised was cool 😂.\\n\\nStory time: When I was six I was at the candy store and saw they had boxes of the chocolate bars that each went for 10 Simoleons at the cinema, and for some reason you never saw them being sold elsewhere. I pulled out my abacus and realised each chocolate bar came out to about 2.50 Simoleons for me (that’s how I discovered arbitrage). Every kid I knew loved those chocolates, so I put down all my savings (the kindergarten I went to had a little shop where you could buy lunch, but I brought my own lunch from home so I just saved my allowance in my piggy bank) and ran a Series A round and bought a box of chocolates, I sold them for a little under the 10 Simoleons, like 9 (what a deal! they thought) and if you bought two they were like 7 *capitalism intensifies*. I was, of course, eventually caught and asked to stop, I was like “You’re punishing me for doing what you’re training us to do. YOU CAN’T HANDLE THE TRUTH!”. So that’s how I got into the habit of reinvesting 😂. I don’t like the idea of working in Finance much though, I used to have a friend who became a broker and he pretty much never slept. Good on you for listening to you and doing something about it, most people don’t. \\n\\nBtw, I’m really glad to hear that you didn’t arrive in Thailand alone and that you learned the ropes from a pro. \\n\\n“Decisions, decisions.” 😂. What other subjects interest you enough to study them? Spare no detail! Or I will imagine you as a pro-wrestling entomologist. Could I ask, in the case of going back to school, have you thought about where? Why do I ask? Pfff no reason, what are you even talking about *closes spreadsheet, takes off cap from Hades, gets up and puts on winged sandals, looks at NDT drinking Kombucha and unboxing his new Kindle device at the dinner table*.\\n\\n“enjoyed doing citations in school 😂 not a lot, just a little bit more than the average person” you need not hide your love of citations. You are talking to somebody who knows about the existence of Bookends (citation software). “So just the right amount to make people have the pepper spray ready when they pass me in the street*” 😂.\\n\\nWhen you put it like that, I guess it would be pretty unnerving to see Bugs Bunny walking around in ”real life”. That is beyond cute that you didn’t know that, even I know LSD is a square-looking thing, and I’ve never done drugs (as previously stated) but now just knowing that I knew made me feel like I’ve been smoking crack my whole life. Wait, is it actually a square-looking thing or a pill? *realises pills are not all one shape. Googles it* wait, what? *scrolls* Oh ok, some pictures show the square-looking thing, others a pill. \\n\\nOk, first of all, who names a movie about football/soccer-playing doggos “Air Buddies”? That sounds like basketball, volleyball, polo, snowboarding, skiing… every other sport except 🐕🐕⚽️ pawball. Also, I’m finding it surprisingly hard to imagine a dog dribbling a ball with their paw across the field, it’s almost impawssible.\\n\\n🥺🥹\\n\\nI forgot to mention earlier how extremely happy I was to receive your 2 billion hugs, I’m still mega-melting from that.\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-10-18T07:11:19.264Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sender\": \"Alberto\",\n    \"text\": \"\\\"Okay this makes me believe that you already sent Rowling fan mail.

I decided that I was being silly and relistened to your voice note from this morning for comfort instead.)\\n\\n😂😂Ah I heard about those women in Vietnam only selling fruit near ramps that align perfectly with boats. They call themselves the Deus Ex Machina, which I think is a little dramatic, but I guess to each their own. \\nI imagined that scene where you guys took the ramps, to be the part in a movie where the video would pause as you guys are mid-air and something like \\\"Thunderstruck\\\" would play and the names of the characters would appear next to them with some funny nickname in quotations under it. Your name will definitely have something to do with \\\"Pug\\\" and your friend something like \\\"Vanilla Ice\\\" (as they both were famous once upon a time and then completely forgotten as time passed).\\n\\n\\n\\\"...one day when I was just chilling in the womb 👶\\\" 😅\\nI completely believe that story happened exactly just like that, and it's so darn cute knowing a part of your personality even as an unborn baby 🥺 It made me want to listen to Beethoven so I went and listened to \\\"Ode an die Freude\\\" and \\\"Für Elise\\\" and for some reason I got a recommended video about nine of the cruelest punishments in history and it is not even close to anything I have ever clicked or will ever click on, so I don't know what that was about. I think Beethoven might have had a dark side and the algorithm knew about it. \\nBut the point is, Beethoven's piano pieces are absolutely beautiful. \\n(I was extremely reluctant to bring this up, so I am really sorry if I rather shouldn't have, but you speak about your dad in the past tense?)\\n\\nI'm pretty versatile when it comes to visual arts and can appreciate anything that evokes an emotion. I won't really say I have a favourite painter, but I like the way the ocean has a whole personality in Ivan Aivazovsky's paintings (it might be due to my dad's influence, but I kind of like boats and airplanes, probably one of the only reasons I watched Pearl Harbour as a kid. After watching that movie, Faith Hill's \\\"There You'll Be\\\" might have made me cry more than I would like to admit. But I am happy to report that I have completely healed from that and can now listen to that song with slight apathy) I'm not a super fan of bright colours in paintings, I tend to lean more towards darker shades, but this is where I sound like a hypocrite because I also like retro art. Yes! Vermeer's paintings are also great! Rembrandt's colour palette is exactly what I referred to when I mentioned darker shades. Is there a specific meaning behind the \\\"Het melksmeisje\\\" painting that makes you like it? Or is it the aesthetic? (I could Google the meaning of the painting, but I prefer to hear it from you) \\n\\nYou had an interest in finance at thirteen?! That is very INTJ of you 😂 also so adorable how curious you were and still are. I don't think there was ever a point in my life where I was interested in finance. When we were introduced to accounting during our first year of highschool, I used to absolutely hate it, but ironically it became the subject I was best at. Same with Geography. Hated it, excelled at it. What can I say? The way to my heart is through hate 😂 (this is 100% completely a joke). \\n\\n\\nWait, hold up, you were really six years old when you figured all of that out? *cough cough* PRODIGY! *cough cough* I am really impressed, but I also can't help to imagine six-year old Alberto yelling at a kid to get off the tire swing as it's your usual spot where you sit and balance your accounts. I picture you with glasses and a dinosaur stuffed toy under your arm as you calculate your parents' taxes on your abacus (*Major Young Sheldon Vibes*🫡)\\nNow I also imagine you constantly correcting your kindergarten teacher using your inside voice and a lot of fruit-themed profanities, because even though you were supposed to be in the fifth grade already, you were also somewhat polite. I might have mixed a little too much of Sheldon's personality in there. \\nAlso, \\\"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!\\\" 😂😂\\n\\nNo I would never have moved here if my brother wasn't here already. The language barrier alone might have been reason enough not to come. \\n\\n\\\"Spare no detail!\\\" you will so regret this. \\nI kind of like the idea of a pro-wrestling entomologist, or at least you imagining me as one. Minus the wrestling part. But keep the \\\"pro\\\" part. \\nI wanted to study psychology at some point but you need to go all the way to doctorate level, which is not a problem, the problem is how limited you are with acceptable programs and routes. For example, in South Africa, to get registered with The Health Professions Council of South Africa, you need to have studied at one of the listed universities and have done your internship during your final year of the masters program at one of the listed institutions. So this kind of goes against the whole 'not being in South Africa' part of the scenario. During the 3 years masters you are also not allowed to work, at all. Not even part-time. And I heard a lot of stories about already qualified and registered psychologists trying to get a job abroad, for example in Australia, but can't get accepted because they don't count the internship year as part of \\\"a studying year\\\" (insane, I know). But I also heard about a \\\"loophole\\\" of starting a practice but registering it as a \\\"coaching\\\" company or something similar. \\nI actually would have studied science with a major in biotechnology, but then I moved to a different city after finishing highschool. When I was younger I always saw myself getting into publishing (hence the Margaret Tate reference that one time) but I guess it's not the best financial decision. So the interests are all over the place, cue indecisiveness. But something that's not really negotiable for me is: I always had this internal need to write a book before I pass away one day, so whichever career I end up in, can not by any means take up every single second of my life (as with finance). And I also kind of promised my language teacher that I would, and she passed away, so I feel obligated (only slightly joking about the feeling obligated part).\\nRegarding where I want to study: It would have to be at a uni that's internationally recognised and also allows me to work while studying, so I kind of had studying online through The University of South Africa in mind, but it's not limited to that. There would be a lot of other options, depending on the situation. \\n(I love that you asked that question by the way)\\n\\\"*closes spreadsheet, takes off cap from Hades, gets up and puts on winged sandals, looks at NDT drinking Kombucha and unboxing his new Kindle device at the dinner table*\\\" 😂 I like how the NDT is always at the dinner table. \\n\\nAahh how romantic to find someone who is not completely appalled by citations.

I think we need to have a discussion on what our dogs look like by the way. \\nThis reminds me of a video I recently saw! (ah darn you algorithm!) It was a snippet of a stand-up comedy show where someone said that people who like pugs are sociopaths. Then he did a bit about how people say, \\\"Oh this is my dog, isn't he cute?

I think I only knew the first one that pops up, “The Shipwreck at the Tempest” because the title sounds familiar. I love paintings of the water! Even when it looks completely different, like in “Pool With Two Figures” 😅.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have to admit, I don’t much remember the movie Pearl Harbor, but I looked up the music video for “There You’ll Be” and I had to stop watching the video very quickly, too sad. I’m glad you are able to listen to the song with “slight apathy” now 😂.  The reason I like “Het Melksmeisje” so much is that something about it feels so real to me. The way it’s framed, my eyes fall on the milkmaid’s hat first, but because the milk jug is in my periphery, I’m already hearing it. By the time my eyes focus on the milk, the bread on the table has entered my periphery and those two in sequence probably trigger my olfactory memory, and the place in the scene looks very homely too. I’ve never seen the original in person, but I can easily picture the place as if I’d been there. I don’t know what  “the critics” say about it, I’ve never much cared for that sort of thing. I also don’t know the story behind the painting 😅. \\n\\n\\n\\nI’m surprised you hated geography, why? 😂 I always thought it was a very chill class.

I know Thailand is famously a haven for Digital Nomads too so I’m guessing there’s a lot of stuff in English as well, but I don’t know.\\n\\n“I kind of like the idea of a pro-wrestling entomologist, or at least you imagining me as one. Minus the wrestling part. But keep the \\\"pro\\\" part” 😂 Ahhh, I was already picturing you wrestling in a Flying Squirrel onesie that grants you the power to glide through the air.\\n\\nI don’t regret asking at all, I’m actually even more curious now 😅. Ohhh wow, those are some very specific regulations, especially with the no-jobs policy.  Three-year master’s was also unexpected. The whole credit revalidation/transfer system seems to be a mess everywhere. *Deletes the part where you said “before I pass away one day”*.  “Whichever career I end up in, can not by any means take up every single second of my life (as with finance)”. This, a million times.\\n\\nI’m sorry to hear about your language teacher. Did she teach you English? I completely get wanting to honour her. \\n\\nI’ve looked into going back to uni abroad a few times, so I happen to know there are indeed systems that allow one to work while studying! I’m not sure if the rules change per area of study, but I would hope at least some do offer that for most majors. There’s also co-op programs in some places, and I’m sure there’s also other options, like you said. I’m glad the question didn’t freak you out, by now, I think you probably already even expected it 😅. Oh yes, NDT is always at the dinner table. I had also been reading about the new Kindle lineup yesterday, it made sense that he’d be getting a new one too, I don’t know where the kombucha came from though 😂.\\n\\nI have the urge to throw my phone out the window all the time! (Well, not lately). I’m just waiting for someone to come out with a decent e-ink phone so that I can pretend it’s some Harry Potter version of a phone with magic paper like an issue of the Daily Prophet.\\n\\n\\\"Feeling like life has kicked you in your crack-addicted stomach?” 😂😂. *Calls your number a million times, phone company thinks it’s some sort of attack on their network*.\\n\\nThat was absolutely lovely, thank you.\\n\\n*Me, ready to give you a septillion hugs now: “Anytime :)”\\n\\nReally?! Thank you , I worked really hard on that one. \\nThat’s such a huge coincidence because I’ve been thinking about sending fan mail for the first time too.  You remembered I like bamboo shoots 🥹. \\n\\n*Reads “In my mind it will always be you” out of context again, 🫠*. Ok, understood, I will try not to cite my quotes (this might be difficult). I think shooting music videos outside has to be the most awkward experience, anytime I watch one I just imagine them lip-syncing in silence while their shoes squeak and trucks honk in the background.\\n\\n“Does this mean the image in your mind when we mention our dogs, are usually pugs for you? (because that is totally okay with me obviously) I am double checking because it's vital that we imagine the same dogs. I think we need to have a discussion on what our dogs look like by the way. ” 🥺🥺🫠 *Walter Mitty*. For some reason, I always picture Labrador dogs as our dogs, HOWEVER, please read next paragraph.\\n\\nOk, so I’ve lived with small dogs, medium dogs and large dogs. Any type of dog is a good dog, but unfortunately, sometimes the bark of large dogs tends to kind of hurt my ears when it’s right next to me (I have sensitive ears, this is not the flex that it sounds like 😅). So I think a more quiet dog would be ideal (I know, almost impawssible), I’m not sure which are the most relaxed or have a lower volume. We had a Chihuahua growing up named Canelo , that guy barked non-stop 😂. \\n\\n(My music streaming app just started playing Only Wanna Be With You, this is very important. Also, what a coincidence that the guy in the song loves Bob Dylan and the song was in Marley & Me.)\\n\\nWhat do our dogs look like to you? (I love saying that 🥹).\\n\\nI watched the stand-up bit that comes up when I searched for “pug comedy bit” where the guy says pugs aren’t dogs, and says they have cow eyes 😅. \\n\\nI am already looking at Otter onesies online, they’re too cute 😂.\\n\\n*Frowns, but secretly really wants you to use that knowledge against him.*\\n\\n“Me: Pulls out the water extractor” 😂.\\n\\n🥹👩‍❤️‍👨🫠🦦❤️🦭\\n\\nOhh ok, I thought I was “tripping”.\\n\\n“Something just moved inside my chest I swear.” 🥺 this made me feel like something was pressed against my chest, like the world’s heaviest pillow (in a very good way).\\n\\n“This made me feel so many overwhelming things all at once. I want to wake up like this with you!!!🥹” 🫠🫠🫠🥺🥹🥹👩‍❤️‍👨 and I want to wake up like that with you!!! I mean it. When I said *closes spreadsheet* last night, that wasn’t a joke (ok, it wasn’t a traditional spreadsheet, but it was something similar).

The second one is also [*redacted*] BUT, the footnote on the second one says: *Can I just say: it’s gonna be legen- wait for it...*\\n\\nB) You know. *Rotten Tomatoes score drops to 0% for being “too predictable”*.\\n\\n*Furiously adds “This might be the ultimate dream for me.

I'll keep in mind to give a warning next time for sad content 😅\\nThen maybe you shouldn't watch the movies I mentioned that's on your watchlist either 😅 I'll try to think of happier movies for you to replace the old ones with. \\n\\nIt's beautiful how you described the painting and your perspective of it. I don't even want to Google the meaning behind it, I prefer to see it the way you described.\\nI think it was just a little boring learning about different types of sand 😂 There were obviously interesting topics as well, but I think compared to the other subjects, it was a little more boring. Maybe the class setup had something to do with it. I remember that no one paid attention in that class and it was always noisy and the kids threw papers and erasers and such around in class, and the teacher was always yelling at someone. Maybe that played a huge role in me not liking it either. \\n\\\"but that makes me feel bad for geography, I'm sure she's trying her best.\\\" 🥺 From now on I will be nice to her.

And if you slightly are, I'll probably find it cute, and if not, I'll have my stapler ready) \\n\\nI don't think I had one, but I might be completely wrong as well. *trying to think of all the stuffed toys I had, remembers the Teletubbies one even though I never really watched it* Nope, I'm almost sure I didn't have a dinosaur one. Did you have a stuffed dinosaur as a kid? 🥺\\n\\nI'd say where I live now (Nakhon Pathom, +- 1h away from Bangkok), it's maybe 90% Google translate. Places like Bangkok and Chiang Mai with more foreigners typically don't have such a big problem with communication. But you kind of have to learn their language a little if you live in smaller areas. \\\"Thailand is famously a haven for Digital Nomads..\\\" I never really understood the hype to be honest 😅 (I'm not denigrating Thailand by the way, it's great in a lot of ways)\\n\\nMe? A flying squirrel? Yes please! Having a suit that enables me to glide through the air? Yes please! \\nWill I glide with the flying squirrel babies and try to convince them that I am their mother? Probably. Will their actual mothers be sad about it? Probably. Is that reason enough for me to not actually do it? Probably. Am I sad about it? Yes. Do I deserve to glide with flying squirrels? Yes.

Absolutely. \\n\\n\\\"*Deletes the part where you said 'before I pass away one day*\\\" 🫠 Thank you, I feel like 60 more years have been added to my life.

What did you have in mind if you don't mind me asking? Or do you just want to study further in the same field? \\nOh yes there are definitely a lot of programs that allow you to work while studying, you're right. It was only the masters for psych at Unisa that doesn't allow it, which was strange because it's not really the norm. \\n\\nOh there's a new Kindle coming out? I see the first ever colour Kindle has been released, you want to tell me that Kindle users have been reading books in black and white all this time? (*Imagines a world where adult novels have pictures on every page so that the above drama is relevant*)\\nIt's so kind of you for including the NDT in the new Kindle lineup. You are even sweet to imaginary objects. See - not like Sheldon Cooper at all! The kombucha gave the NDT personality. I will now forever imagine the NDT as someone who daydreams about buying a boat and retiring in Hawaii. \\n(Also, I am pretty sure I know what NDT is, but I feel like we just need to confirm that we are on the same page here. What is NDT to you?)\\n\\nI will 100% share in your imagination with the Harry Potter e-ink phone. I like how we can probably talk about paperclips and still connect it to Harry Potter in some way. Speaking about the Daily Prophet, are you: \\nA) sad\\nB) not affected because you are a psychopath\\nC) happy\\nabout the fact that newspapers are not so popular anymore and that print journalism are basically going extinct? \\nOf course I remembered you like bamboo shoots!

I don't mind either way! You can cite the orgin of every single word in every single sentence you sent for all that I care. I just meant that you don't HAVE to, I won't think anything negative of it. But it's completely up to you. (Probably the longest conversation I ever had regarding \\\"to cite or not to cite\\\", Shakespeare, W. (1603) Hamlet. Act 3, Scene 1.)\\n\\nOkay, to be completely honest, initially I also imagined Labradors, really really. But then I thought that in movies it's usually Labradors or Golden Retrievers so I'll try to switch it up a bit. Hence the Border Collies. \\\"Ok, so I've lived with small dogs, medium dogs and large dogs. Any type of dog is a good dog,\\\" 😂 so poetic. \\n\\n*Gets bingo card* \\nI've also lived with all sizes of dogs and can fully agree that the barking is a problem for me as well. I, too, don't like loud noises so that was definitely a flex in my opinion 😂 \\nHow do you feel about trading the imaginary dogs for imaginary cats? Or would our imagination not like that? Also, can we please never imagine to have parrots? I can't stand their noisiness either. My dad absolutely loves birds, which means I woke up to the agonising sound of screaming birds every morning for a very long time. \\nYou really had a Chihuahua? 😂 Those guys are like a breeding ground for memes 😂 I think Canelo was at least 70% responsible for your sense of humour. \\n\\n(Part 2 is coming soon!)\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-10-19T18:21:58.647Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sender\": \"Karla\",\n    \"text\": \"The app is a little glitchy by the way, closing by itself, just a heads up.\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2024-10-19T18:25:19.485Z\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sender\": \"Alberto\",\n    \"text\": \"Youuuu. 🥺.

It would be new and exciting and you'd get to experience something a very high statistic of humans never will.” That used to be my opinion too. There’s a videogame I played a long time ago called Mass Effect where you can travel to other planets and at the time I thought that if I could, I’d go and do that in a picosecond. But then I realised I’d probably go bananas without the arts and familiar nature and animals. Is Earth really so bad when we have harbour seals here? I think not. If I did go, I’d probably end up drawing a smiley face on my Kindle and calling it “Wilson” like in Castaway. “Also, I can see how that can be psychoanalysed in a certain way, and I can with absolute certainty say that it is not connected to anything else.” This was very comforting. I want to state for the record that I can say with absolute certainty that my thoughts on this also are not in any way to be related to that psychoanalytic interpretation.\\n\\n“Also, all of this made me think of Megamind for some reason.” I love Megamind!

There used to be this thing called Nanowrimo that was mostly not something that authors actually cared about, but it was good to get hobbyists to push themselves to try and finish a rough first draft of a novel in a month. There had been controversies surrounding them before and their reputation (rightfully) took a dive in recent years, but recently they decided to complete their societal seppuku by praising AI and saying everyone who doesn’t love it is a fascist (I’m paraphrasing). Of course, nobody liked that. Now virtually everyone that was interested in the event has formed or migrated to writing groups just to keep the spirit going. I have absolutely no idea why I’m sharing this. \\n\\n“leave to play Chicken Invaders on the PC 😂” for some reason I found that very funny, I don’t even know the game *looks up Chicken Invaders* oohhhhh it’s Space Invaders, but with chickens!

But then I thought “wait a minute”, and I opened my browser again and the page with my track upload said “processing”, so apparently they started re-processing my track all over again. I just hit cancel. I searched for “Phlebas” on Spotify (the “Artist name” I’d chosen), and nothing pops up, so I think they’ve deleted it. I didn’t even like the name Phlebas anyway *sobs*. No, I actually don’t much like the sound of it 😅. Fortunately, it seems that because my account has been verified or something, new uploads can be released almost immediately! There’s a dropdown menu that lets me select when to release, and the lowest option is tomorrow’s date, so that’s awesome! I’ll be re-uploading tomorrow, but this time I’ll be choosing a name I like more, hopefully (the name Phlebas comes from a poem. I found the poem by looking up a novel I haven’t read yet, titled “Consider Phlebas”, I was curious what the name meant 😅 it’s actually pretty cool, so I’d just gone with that because every name under the sun seems to be taken. Also, I remembered what you said about how it’s the artist that makes the name and not the other way around. But now that I have to pick a name again - phonetically, I think I’d like something with more panache).  I thought of going with “Melbrook” because in the Superpowereds books our heroes live in “Melbrook Hall”, but then I googled “Melbrook” and I get Mel Brooks 😂😂.

Sorry for assuming, and right after you’d just said you didn’t want to assume about my Spanish fluency. You have my permission to call me a dimwit and throw a stapler at me. \\n\\nThe main reason I’d looked into going back to uni was because I was considering moving abroad and needed a reason to be there for years while also not just moving there to do the same thing. If I were to stay in the same field, I’d like to at least do something more rewarding (even if not necessarily more enjoyable), like working at a game studio. Making games is very difficult and you usually get paid less 😅 but at least you have something work-related to get excited about. Otherwise, there’s a few things I could do that are related to the field but not as draining, like systems architecture, cybersecurity or even UX design, those are somewhat adjacent. If I woke up with Bezos money, I’d probably just study music production or creative writing, BUT obviously not if I had any actual financial commitments 😂. A kind of ideal scenario would be to arrive somewhere to study part-time to ”get a foot in the door” in another unrelated field (say, electrician or something), whilst working a job in one’s current field. That said, I’m flexible, and this is all subject to change in the event that there’s a huge shift in the labour market. Also, the place plays a factor, different markets reward the same skills differently. \\n\\nOk this is absolutely cracking me up 🤣 I was reading the part where you say \\\"the Kombucha gave the NDT personality\\\" I'm like what could she mean by that? 😅 I've been using NDT as short for Neil deGrasse Tyson ever since that time we were talking about him. What have you been picturing??? 😂😂. \\n\\nOne of my responsibilities from ages able-to-walk until I left for uni was to collect the newspapers from the mailbox every morning. We always got a finance one and a regional one containing general news (\\\"General News\\\" 🫡). I never liked that they came sealed in plastic. I always loved the finance one, specially when they had stories that you'd never think to look up, like about how the cost of some random commodity being higher had likely been catalysed some seemingly unrelated event from months before. My father would always read one in the morning and the other one on his lunch break from work. On Sundays we went to a newsstand that got monthly magazines from the states, Germany and other places. I never read the regional paper, so I never knew what was going on in the area 😅. In highschool, my friend/drummer's family owned the local newspaper (since forever), and I remember thinking that with the way the internet was taking over everything, ours would probably be the last generation where that was even a viable business model, and that made me a little sad too. So I do greatly miss the newspaper, it's a very nostalgic thing for me, like a time capsule. And that smell... ahhhhh, ink fumes. I do however feel sorry for all the trees.\\n\\nYes!!! You may regret asking anything related to e-ink. *Inhales deeply* The whole point of e-ink is that it's not actually a screen in the traditional sense. Unlike any other screen technology (CRT, plasma, LCD, LED, RLCD, OLED, etc.), there's no light array used to display image, there's no backlight (there's a front-light you can turn on, but that's really just an array of tiny lightbulbs that sits on top, instead of behind, the reading panel. This serves the same use as a lightbulb for physical books). The way it produces image is through lots of tiny \\\"ink\\\" capsules that change values, from totally filled (black) to empty, to thousands of grey values in between. It's pure chemistry and amazing use of electrical principles working together with the computer to tell them how to rearrange themselves. The ink capsules stay in that same charge until the image changes, this is why e-readers last weeks to months on a charge. As a result of all this, it is essentially the same as reading on paper, so it doesn't strain your eyes any more than paper would. \\n\\nI've been reading black and white e-ink since the Sony PRS-505 and never really minded not having colour 😅 BUT I always wanted book covers to show up when the device was sleeping, I waited so many years for that, I was SO happy when we finally got it. To this day I stare at the cover for a bit before and after reading sessions 😅. I even have a whole automated workflow to download the books to my computer and make the covers fit right, before sending them to my Kindle, because otherwise you get huge black bars on either side of the cover, and that looks super lame (come on, Amazon, seriously?). Also, from a practical standpoint, book covers can be different sizes by default (\\\"...like on a bookshelf?\\\" 😅), so the books don't even line up in your library! It makes it harder to navigate when you have a lot of titles. All of this is to say, I really love my book covers, which is one of the main selling points of colour e-readers, but I'm not sure it's worth the trade-off. With our current tech, the screen has to be made darker to display colours, so you need the front-light on 24/7. I'll stick with B&W for now. Are you happy about the fact that newspapers are not so popular anymore and that print journalism is basically going extinct?\\n\\n*Thinks that maybe she intended to phrase it like that for exactly this reason* \\nI was hoping you’d say something like that, I just wanted to hear it from you 🫠.

Sees us discovering new animal and plant species on planet. Building forts and telling each other made up stories to make up for the lack of literature on the planet. Fast forward to us being older and having to write scientific journals about the planet and report back to Earth. We have managed to build a small house at this point, which is filled with storybooks we wrote as kids. We somehow made medicine using the plants on the planet and have several pets. One day, we saw a spacecraft landing on our planet with five passengers inside. They were sent to join us on the planet. *insert ominous music*. Will we all get along?

Me: Yeah, I agree, it does sound a little bit Baader-Meinhof-ish, but it is pretty cool to try and see it from the more “spoOoky” angle.

I think he laced it with crack or something because anytime I think about you I feel my chest get weak.\\n\\nThat whole story about us being raised on another planet was so cute 🥹. I really enjoyed reading that and picturing it in my mind’s eye. Who the hecc do those five passengers think they are, intruding on our little slice of paradise?! I need to know what happens next! \\n\\nI haven’t seen \\\"IO\\\", but there is a movie called “I Am Mother” where the protagonist is raised by a machine too, I liked that one! I just saw that it came out in 2019, so that’s probably one of the top three most recent movies I’ve seen 😂. “Also, this makes me want to watch movies with you so badly 🥹” this made me imagine us on the couch in our pyjamas, your head on my shoulder, me stroking your hair and annoying you by kissing your cheek every few minutes 👩‍❤️‍👨.\\n\\nI have a few short stories that I see reaching novella length, but I’d start writing them from zero.  I might pick one of those or start a brand new one, the possibilities are endless! But yes some of those do involve superpowers (perhaps more than “some” 😂). I might re-write my short story about the guy who lives in a world where superheroes are government-sanctioned and he lives in a mega-remote town that has zero budget and also no crime, so the local government only has a 100 year old hero on the payroll who really would rather spend his time taking it easy. But one day, there is a theft in town, the local cheesemonger has had the town’s pride and joy stolen, a wheel of cheese that commemorates their only big local tradition. The hero in the story has a superpower that he’s never told people about because he’s embarrassed, but now, his super-nose will save the day! If only he can get the townspeople to take his investigation seriously.\\n\\nI’m going to choose to believe that you dreamt of us dancing “cheek to forehead” (🥹) and just forgot. The zoom in on the mosquitoes dancing jazz 😂😂 . \\n\\n*realises he already asked about the tiny letter places inside a separate locked compartment in the vanilla ice-cream cone*.\\n\\nHonestly, those Atari games are super fun! Much more fun than a lot of modern games.

I know what you mean, I also don’t like the idea of riding a horse. It was my cousins who did the competing, my aunt and my uncle just really like horses 😂.   I’m not afraid of horses! I’m just wary 😂. I had gotten off the horse when I went to stand under the tree and then the Great Bee Incident of [insert year] ensued. \\n\\nI really really want to reply to the next message right now, but it’s 00:42 and I kind of secretly promised someone I would be going to bed early tonight (even if I did pre-order a few hours worth of sleep).

(The first time I took him outside, he was afraid of grass.) But I was also concerned about the hunting and wouldn't have been able to deal with him bringing some animal back home.

If you are here, it means your character experienced something we like to call 'euphoria.' Euphoria is an extremely rare emotion and can only be triggered by one very specific character in the game. When your character is in the state of euphoria, there are a few things you need to be weary of: They might find themselves randomly smiling throughout the day. Now this might not seem harmful or something to be concerned about, but the NPC's might think your character has been infected by some virus and plan an attack. Your character might also zone out and engage in intense daydreaming sessions. This can happen at the most inconvenient times and we suggest that you not send your character into battle during this state. It's also advisable that your character stays within a 1mm radius from the character that caused the euphoria, or her health will rapidly decrease, leading to certain death.\\\"\\n\\nI'm glad you liked the giant butterfly saddle 😂 it was designed by Edna from The Incredibles.\\n\\\"I did wake up hugging you I mean my pillow again, I remember being very happy about the dream,\\\" 🫠 \\n*Sees the word \\\"happy\\\", nods to self.

Well, yes, briefly. I got on the stage to play every chance I could (it’s one of my favourite things to do), but it was usually by myself (I just remembered there was a picture of 11-year-old me playing the violin all alone at one of those events, I wonder if it’s still lying around somewhere). The music teacher and I got along splendidly and he’d always tag me to lead group-based performances where it was kids from different years 😂 I’m not counting those as bands because the groups changed.  \\n My friend, I never asked why, lived alone. This meant that we could go to his house after school sometimes and jam out, which of course was fun. I’d sing and play rhythm guitar and this other kind from another school played lead guitar, and there was another kid who played bass from yet another school as well. After a while, we started jamming out with these two kids from our school who were a year younger, one was on bass and the other had keys & backing vocals.  One time we somehow ended up signing up for some school event as a band, “the Rickies” (after our bass man, Ricky 😂). That time I got to play bass and backing vocals, except for when it came time to sing AC/DC (I’m not a devil worshipper), which was a spur-of-the-moment ask by the band, we never practised that song before, but the crowd loved it (teenage angst). I also unfortunately kind of had to take over the vocals during the chorus of Munich by Editors, which had been my pick for the setlist and during which Tony got a little shy for some reason. Overall, a very fun day.\\n\\n  Thanks! I really like hearing your stories too :)\\n\\nThat made me feel a little bad for the squirrels 😅 so I looked it up and found an article by Scientific American from 2023 that has a lot of interesting data. Did you know “A single squirrel can bury up to 3,000 nuts in a season”? I didn’t. They also cite a study *chuckles in a smug way* which I had just read on Science Direct before clicking on the “Sci-Am” article,   and which observed that the squirrels in the study “could plan a trajectory through their 10 caches, which they could only do if they had a memory of where those caches were”. Maybe they’re purposefully leaving the older and not-as-desirable nuts behind as they get better stock? Just like when you’re at the supermarket and you hide the good package at the back and leave the destroyed one at the front, so that your competition will take those instead, and then you can come back and get the good one after you’ve made a decision later. Don’t pretend like you haven’t done that, I see you.  \\n\\nI’m really glad you find the story interesting! I really ought to finish that one. By the way, have I told you that you make me happy? Because you do *sneaks in quick kiss on your cheek*.\\n\\nYou too?! *pulls out bingo card, sad to hear that you also get digital _screen-related headaches*. About why colour e-readers are currently darker than their black & white counterparts, it’s because the colour part of it comes from a layer that sits on top, called a ”filter array”. This makes the screen appear more dim.\\n\\nGood judgement call! The Andromeda and Perseus “incident” greatly enriched my life, no need to worry.\\n\\n*Guy wearing the glasses in my head slowly takes off the glasses to reveal he’s… me! - Audience gasps*.\\n\\nHave you seen those videos where they strap action cameras to cats and we get to see a day in the life of an outside cat? It’s sooo wild! No wonder they feel like the kings of the world. Those guys will be jumping across rooftops like Batman, shimmying down the boughs of trees 30ft high at normal speed, fighting other cats, chasing innocent animals, meeting up with other cats in highly specific secret spots, etc. Those guys are something else. \\n\\n“If the bird screams, you scream louder?” I pictured that 😂😂. \\n\\n“So she not only stays up typing for the sake of your happiness, but also for her own.” 🥺🥺 then you will understand why I’m writing at this hour too 👫.\\n\\nOhhhh, yes that makes sense! *pulls out bottom half of tiny letter* my half looks like a V, it’s also red! *places it next to yours, taps your shoulder so you look the other way*.\\n\\nBanana Pancakes makes me picture that very same thing! Except I’ve made us banana pancakes for breakfast, yours come with blueberries arranged in the shape of a heart, as well as raisins and chocolate, and of course, I’ve also made you a cup of coffee just how you like it. \\n\\n“I fully live by the delusion that no one else in the world has bingo cards. It’s an us thing.” That caused me to melt so much 🥺🫠.\\n\\nYour paragraph about euphoria 🥺🥺 thank you for telling me what it’s called, I unlocked it too! *I tie our shoelaces together, then we start walking, holding hands. A few steps later we trip and fall, rolling down a hill (we are wearing the best protective gear ever, you are safe)*.\\n\\nIt was designed by Edna! 😂😂😂.\\n\\n“Waking up to that song and thinking about you is honestly one of the best feelings in the world.” 🥺🥺 I feel the same way when I wake up thinking about you (which is always)💘🦋. \\n\\nI’m really excited to write my next message, but it’s midnight and you asked me to go to sleep early tonight, so Part II will come tomorrow. By the way, I like you. I hope you’re having a wonderful day, and I hope I’ll get to dream of you again tonight while I hug my Karla pillow. I am stroking your cheek gently before I kiss it softly and sending you twelve trillion hugs, cuddles and kisses.

When I was very young I read a book about Einstein and it said that there’s enough energy contained in the atoms of a regular ball pen to out-do an A-bawmb (by means of fission, not just by throwing it at people. You would have to be really strong for that), so there’s probably a simple way to connect a pen to a supernova too. I may have never watched Friends, but I know Phoebe is rather woo-woo, right?

As cute as that would be if I’d written it after our cheese rolling bit, I wrote the start of it in September of 2023. It’s rather rough because it was just for my daily exercise where I like to write without stopping, but here’s a little excerpt:\\n\\n[Bobby adjusted his cowboy hat as he entered “Betty’s Cheese”, trying to look cool. There was no one  at the counter. A few seconds later, Maggie emerged, the ten-year-old daughter of the proprietor. “Hey Bobby, err, mister Bobby, how can we help you today?” She said, trying to look professional. “Hey Maggie, is your mom around?”. She frowned. “Yes, but she’s busy”. “Could you ask her to come out for a minute? It’s kind of important”. She looked outraged. “Fine”, she said, and stomped off to the back. There was a thump on a door, and whispers were exchanged. After a minute, a plump, middle-aged woman walked up to the counter, looking as if she’d been sleeping. She stared at Bobby. He stared back, thinking she smelled oddly un-cheese-like, something like Maraschino cherries. He tipped his cowboy hat. “Howdy, Mrs. Boyd, I -” she cut him off, “What can we do for you today?” . He cleared his throat. “Straight to bidness” he said, and cringed. “Well, see, I’m with the school newspaper, we’re doing a piece about the stolen cheddar, but I’m also doing an independent-”. She stared at his hat, unblinking. He continued, “see, I have a unique set of skills, that -“, she cut him off, “Look son, there isn’t much to tell. I closed up, come morning, wheel was gone, that’s it. I already told that Henderson kid with the newspaper. But we’ll be ok now, I had the locks changed, plus we got a dog to guard the door at night”, she pointed to the chihuahua sleeping in the corner.]\\n\\nBut speaking of projects, I’ve been working on a little surprise for you (that’s why my messages have been a little bit shorter lately. I know this makes it a little less of a surprise, that’s ok), it’ll still be a little while before it’s ready, but I can’t wait to show you. \\n\\nI can’t believe you played Enduro too! Not a lot of people seem to know about it, so that’s really cool.\\n\\n“with my head resting on your shoulder, running my fingertips softly across your back while you play games and every now and then, I would give your shoulder a kiss.” Reading this made time stop for me, I now can’t stop imagining your head on my shoulder and your fingers running across my back💘🦋🫠. I’d just play with one hand so I could run my fingers across your back too, and we watch me lose over and over at the videogame. \\n\\n“I'm really glad you liked me calling you that 🥺”\\n\\nTo be quite honest, “liked” is an understatement. Then again, there aren’t many things you could call me that I wouldn’t like. Except maybe for “$!#%^ sack of #&^%@$&” and “@$^$@!!!”.\\n\\n“And I feel like a complete idiot for feeling about you the way that I do.” That low-key sounds like a diss 😅. I feel the same way about you, but it makes me feel like a complete genius because there’s no better person to feel this way about than you, nobody. (But I know exactly what you mean and it makes me so happy that you said that).\\n\\nWhen you said you had the day off I almost asked if you wanted to have a phone call, but I didn’t want to bother you. I wonder, what does Karla Swanepoel do on her day off? *cue “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” opening monologue*.\\n\\nI’m glad you’ve sent me voice notes because now I can read your messages in your voice 🫠. Also, you mentioned re-listening to my voice notes, do you just scroll infinitely up until you reach them? I’ve been doing that 😂.\\n\\n  “a tornado of butterflies inside of me 🦋🌪” is exactly how you make me feel all the time, but especially when you say words like “us” and “kisses” and “hugs” and “cuddles” and “holding your had in mine and tracing your fingerprints with my fingertip” ❤️❤️👩‍❤️‍👨👫. \\n\\n(I know that’s not one word, but this is no time for grammer!)\\n\\n“Something about its job description that suddenly changed since I met you and it feels overworked.” sweetest 🥺🥺. It’s the same with my heart 🫀. \\n\\nI have been feeling better yes, thank you so much! See I told you singing to you would help.\\n\\n“Hires a random person and pays them an extreme amount of money in $1 bills over a period of 7 years to fabricate the results.” 😂😂🥺\\n\\nYour goodnight message just now made a lot of different music play in my head at the same time. Songs like “Beyond the Sea“, I’m A Believer, “I’m Making Believe” (again) and Only You, by The Platters. I too have been looking into teleportation extensively and whilst my research is not yet complete, I do believe there is promising progress underway. \\n\\nUntil then, I’m sending you kisses for your cheeks and forehead, your hands, your shoulder and the sides of your eyes, and I’m cuddling my Karla pillow until I fall asleep.

Even though there's one spot on the floor that's squeaky and the washing machine makes a weird noise and the neighbours have terrible taste in music and one of the windows get stuck sometimes which makes the rain come inside, none of that matters. It's perfect.*\\n\\n\\n\\\"My chest is a tornado of butterflies and my eyes are starting to tear up a little. This is all I want.\\\" My heart 🥹🥲♥️ This is all I want too. \\n\\nYour second paragraph 🥹 \\\"it was emotional for me to sing that, I was picturing that you were in front of me when I recorded it. I always picture I'm singing to you\\\" 🥹 I'm picturing you picturing me while you're singing and it makes me want to give you the biggest hug. It's so sweet. I picture you here all the time, doesn't really matter what I'm doing. Whether I'm lying in bed or I'm just doing laundry or dishes or whatever, you're here. \\n\\n\\\"I would not be totally opposed to reading you a chapter or two in bed sometime (I just pictured doing all the dramatic bits and acting it out 😂😂).\\\"\\n*Intense daydreaming. Snow White starts singing. Happiness meter explodes*.\\n\\n\\\"*Scours the world for a box of Despicable Me plasters*\\\" 🫠\\n\\nI thought the exact same thing. There are so many factors contributing to and affecting a person's logic, mentality, intelligence, EQ, etc., besides one's DNA. \\n\\nI shall remind myself I'm human and resist the urge to try and find your book amongst millions of books with similar titles. \\n\\n\\\"The 'Fludd' thing was like watching a bad horror movie\\\" you had me on board with only this part already.\\n\\\"When I was very young I read a book about Einstein\\\" I expected nothing less 😅 picturing you 3-years old with an Einstein book. \\nOh my gosh, that's interesting! I want to watch a video about that this weekend. *goes to make note in calendar, accidentally opens clock instead, still refuses to move the two apps away from each other even though this happens all the time*. To be honest, I actually suspected you would find a way to connect a pen to a supernova :)\\n\\nI'm delighted that you got to use the word \\\"woo-woo\\\" too. Phoebe is indeed, but in a cute way. We like her. She was a surrogate for her brother and his wife. (This is not an example of why we like her, this is just a random fact that I like to bring up sometimes because it haunts me until this day and I can't keep it inside and deal with it alone). \\n\\nI don't think I have ever watched Home Alone (*hands you a pillow and a stapler, the choice is yours*), but I like the addition of the roughed up beanie and a smear of grease on his cheek. This made me think of William Smee in Once Upon a Time. \\n\\\"I just know that's exactly what I feel when I think of you, oh look, there it is right now.\\\" 🫠🥺 \\n\\n\\\"Ahh, see, your mistake was assuming I'd even care about any movie playing (or anything else) when you're right there.\\\" \\nHow can someone be this sweet?🥹💘👩‍❤️‍👨 the things you do to my heart can not be healthy. \\n\\n*reads your story* \\nTen-year-olds can be so dramatic. \\n\\\"He stared back, thinking she smelled oddly un-cheese-like\\\" 😂\\n\\\"she cuts him off\\\" now I see where Maggie gets her bad attitude from. \\n\\\"She pointed to the chihuahua sleeping in the corner\\\" 😂😂\\nYour sense of humour in your stories are just 👌🏻 at this point I'm fully convinced you could write about dandelions and make people fall from their chairs laughing. Thank you so much for sharing that with me, I love reading your stories. \\n\\nYou what? 🥹 I'm obviously very curious about the surprise, but I'm stunned. I don't expect you to invest even more of your time in me 🥹 Your messages are more than enough and it already takes so much time to reply. \\nThank you for explaining that, I appreciate it. But I don't care about the length of your messages, I am just happy to hear from you. \\\"You could send nothing but a potato emoji 🥔 and I'd be happy.\\\" I've been trying to make my recent messages a little shorter to make it easier for you to reply. Also, you don't always have to reply on everything, I will really 100% understand.\\nBy the way, I have a surprise for you too. It's something I've been thinking about for some time now, but it's not something you will receive any time soon. \\n\\n\\\"I'd just play with one hand so I could run my fingers across your back too, and we watch me lose over and over at the videogame.\\\" 🫠💘🦋🌪 *pulls phone closer to face to imitate scootching closer to you* Sooo many butterflies imagining you running your fingers across my back. I had to stop typing for a few minutes to daydream about this. \\n\\nReally, you wouldn't like it if I called you \\\"$!#%^\\\" ? I thought this was kind of a cute name. So many married couples call each other that, I thought it was supposed to be romantic? \\n(I would obviously never call you that! I don't know how to pronounce the \\\"$!#\\\" part in any way). \\n\\nI can see how it may have sounded like a diss 😂😂 it was sooo far from a diss though! \\n\\\"but it makes me feel like a complete genius because there's no better person to feel this way about than you, nobody\\\" 🥹🥹🥲🥲🦋🦋 this left me speechless and made me feel so many things 🥹♥️ \\n*insert \\\"By My Side\\\" by The Paper Kites and pardon the not-so-cheerful melody, it's the lyrics that count*\\nAnd I agree with you. There is no better person to feel this way about than you, nobody. \\n\\n\\\"but I didn't want to bother you\\\" this is the saddest sentence 🥲 The fact that you think you could bother me is astonishing. I don't want you to ever think or feel that way. By the way, I'm emailing you my number since we are scared this app might spam us. If you have WhatsApp, I'll be waiting for your message :)\\nKarla's \\\"day off\\\" consists of work mostly 😅 so not really a \\\"day off\\\" but I did manage to take a nap which is always great. \\nBy the way the opening monologue to \\\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\\" 😂 \\n\\\"...you lick your palms. It's a little childish and stupid, but so is highschool.\\\" 😂\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad you've sent me voice notes because now I can read your messages in your voice 🫠.\\\" 🫠 (I'm pretty sure I don't even type in my own voice though 😅)\\nOohh I used to just scroll until my thumb went numb yes 😂 but then yesterday or 2 days ago I took a screen recording of each of your voice notes so now it's saved as separate \\\"videos\\\" on my phone. \\n\\n\\\"a tornado of butterflies inside of me 🦋🌪 is exactly how you make me feel all the time, but especially when you say words like 'us' and 'kisses' and 'hugs' and 'cuddles' and 'holding your hand in mine and tracing your fingerprints with my fingertip' ♥️♥️👩‍❤️‍👨👫.\\\" \\n\\nOkay first of all: ♥️♥️👩‍❤️‍👨👫\\nSecond of all: \\nus\\nkisses\\nhugs\\ncuddles\\nholding your hand in mine and tracing your fingerprints with my fingertip\\nus\\nkisses, hugs, cuddles, us\\n\\nI should have believed you when you told me singing to me would help, I sincerely apologise. I was blinded, but blinded I shall be no more. \\n\\nI went and listened to all the songs you mentioned and chuckled a little when \\\"Beyond the Sea\\\" started playing because it reminded me of the 🦭🦦 emojis 😅\\nAll of the songs are extremely beautiful, thank you for mentioning them. Only You by The Platters 🫠🫠🥺\\nYou make me feel \\\"Only One\\\" by Kodaline. \\n\\nAlso, good morning cutest! ☀️\\nI hope you're having a great morning so far and that you'll continue to have a great day. I'm happy to know you. *insert Paperweight by Joshua Radin and Schuyler Fisk and only keep the good parts* \\nAlso, I randomly remembered again that we will probably be reading chapter 3 of our book this weekend (?) and it sent a rush of happiness through me. \\nI'm sending you so many hugs and cuddles that you'd need an oxygen mask to help you breathe. I'm kissing your forehead, your cheeks, your hands, your shoulder, your chest and your chin.
