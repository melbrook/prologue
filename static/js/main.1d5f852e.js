I swear, people who dislike berries are the same ones who blame the chair after stubbing their toe and watch 'How to Pet a Rock' videos on YouTube.\n\nI wasn't familiar with Discworld City Watch so had to Google it, and man oh man, did the description give me vertigo. \"Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle.\"\nI can't decide whether Terry Prachett was extremely creative or extremely high on LSD. Nevertheless, it sounds very interesting! And that is \"interesting\" that stands on the back of \"genius\", which balances on the head of \"stupendous\". \n\nFortunately I've never broken a single one.\nOh my! What happened?? With you on blaming gravity already, but what happened? \nSpeaking of Newton inventing gravity...have you seen that video of the woman saying \"Like, if you think about it, we don't really need gravity, like, we were like fine before gravity was like invented. Like x100, like\" ?\nOr were you actually referring to that video? \ud83d\ude05\n\nYou shouldn't resist *smiles like Agnes from Despicable Me after Gru gives her a unicorm stuffed toy*\nAahhhhh I went and listened to it and I'm 100% convinced that that piano piece revived at least 48 people from the dead in Milan and 108 in Norway. It's soooo pretty! \n\nI'm also not familiar with Dungeon Crawler Carl, so went to look it up as well. It sounds really great! It's apparently humorous and he even travels through a dungeon with his cat! That is definitely going on my bucket list. \nI can picture it \ud83d\ude02*Imagining the most feminine meow catly possible*\nYou are one scotch on the rocks away from being the perfect Barney Stinson replacement. \n\nYou read 4 novels in a month? Dang it. Which 4 Stephen King novels did you pick? And on top of that there's audio books as well. You are on a roll mister. October is looking good so far. Aahhh wait is the Stephen King novels because it's Halloween in October? \n\nI usually make it to Sweden and back in 2 paragraphs, but I stubbed my toe on this chair and we got into this heated argument over it. The chair said some things it didn't mean, I said some things that I did in fact mean. Things got out of control, there were splinters involved. I had to analyse if I still like berries after the incident. Turned out I still did, so the journey proceeded. \n\nThat is a very interesting hypothesis you've got there Socrates *takes a puff from my pipe* very interesting indeed. Dare we discuss this matter with Plato, whose intellect often dances upon the precipice of pretension? To discuss or not to discuss- this is indeed a question worthy of our deliberation. \n\nThat's a very interesting combination of genres you have there. That combination of genres might be even more powerful than the combination of phonetics in \"premature earth....\" (won't make that mistake twice) \nI might have been responsible for the sky splitting open, but you, you will be responsible for a black hole sucking in all of existence.

Hmmm.\n\nI didn't hate the ending to the extent that I wanted to defenestrate the TV for delivering the message to my eyeballs, but I did feel a little underwhelmed (though I did cry a lot, obviously). I think I'd been expecting a huge twist for the ending ever since S7E12. I love that show so much, but it made me so sad when it ended that I only ever re-watched the first few episodes when afflicted with the Flu debuff and I needed comforting. Even though The Big Bang Theory is my ultimate comfort watch.  I\u2019ve only seen S1 of Prison Break, but I thought putting DB Cooper in the show was brilliant.

I wrote a short story about it once *opens filing cabinet* I just looked it up, here\u2019s an excerpt: \n\n\n\u201cIt had rained the night before, and there were still beads of dew pooling around the chipped blue paint of the rails - bad for the grip, specially with the sweaty palms of a six-year-old. I don\u2019t remember what came first, the heat or the kid running away. Suddenly, some invisible man had taken hold of my neck and was emptying a can of compressed air into my nose, like a sneeze in reverse, hot metal. I felt my heart pounding in my head and there was a Polaroid haze to the moment, I was afraid the world would be pulled out of me. The heat, rising in my thighs as the crowd, the limb-mass, encroached around my vision. I was a stubborn tooth in a pair of pliers, those slow and overwhelming moments where your body is trying to tell you how handsomely wrecked you are, but your brain doesn\u2019t want to listen. \n\nI don\u2019t remember what my arm looked like then, just brief flashes. Heat, blood, a stranger\u2019s arms, haze. With my head hanging limp off the side of my hero\u2019s shoulder as she sprinted along the top row of the main hall, I realised that nobody in the agora had noticed the wailing scene in the playground. How I hated that music they were playing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll be looking up that video shortly!\n\nAhhh, I can\u2019t say no to that mental picture! *falls to one knee, clutching his chest*. I am SO glad you think so too, I absolutely love that piece.\n\nI think I would make the world\u2019s worst Barney Stinson replacement, but I will take that as a compliment! (I think).\n\nI picked up \u2019Salems Lot, The Shining, The Stand and Fairy Tale. I have the audiobooks but haven\u2019t listened to them yet.

You cried?! Damn, why does hearing that make me so happy? I'm not a sadist, I swear. Yesss, I can relate to that! It was extremely sad when it ended; I also took some time before my first rewatch. Aahhh The Big Bang Theory, also a great show. Have you seen Young Sheldon? Prison Break was one of those shows that made you experience the full spectrum of emotions in just one episode. It's emotionally exhausting and addictive at the same time. A psychologist is highly advisable once you've finished watching the entire show.\n\nWHAT?! This is a joke, right? Nah, I don't want to believe that. I prefer to remain delusional. How can he have made so much money from something so...?\n\nWell, for my 16th birthday, someone fetched a rock from their garden and gave it to me as a gift. No, they were not joking. No, they were not mentally challenged. Yes, they were in high school as well. And yes, they did, in fact, seem excited to hand me the gift.\n\nOmg, you can write about anything and make it sound like a New York Times bestseller. Gosh, I wish breaking your bones was like having chickenpox in the sense that if you had it once, you wouldn't have it again. And, of course, you would notice the music, even after breaking your arm. What music did they play?\n\nDo you know Yiruma and Ludovico Einaudi? Kiss the Rain by Yiruma is also sooo pretty!

South Africa (impressive, right?). I would say it\u2019s a pretty big deal here, so much so that we kind of have it two days in a row, first Halloween and then the Day of the Dead. Enthusiasm around Halloween varies by state/city/neighbourhood/person, but in my area you always see kids (and sometimes adults going door to door as well, in suspiciously intricate costumes, under the guise of chaperones)  trick or treating. They'll even say \"trick or treat\" (albeit usually in Spanish) and I've even seen groups sing little Halloween songs in English, which feels like being transported to an episode of the Twilight Zone. I greatly enjoy Halloween, even though I\u2019m not big into horror. \n\nOne universally loved thing about Day of the Dead is a type of bread you can only find in October, maybe up to the second week of November. It\u2019s called \u2018Pan de Muerto\u2019 (Bread of the Dead) and that\u2019s about as badass a name as a bread can have.\n\nHmmm, I\u2019ve never been particularly adept at that type of crafts, so I don\u2019t go for the dress-up shenanigans, except that time I picked out an outfit that was an almost exact match of Martin Freeman\u2019s John Watson\u2019s.\n\nYou are most welcome!

Also, permission granted to dream whole new episodes for himym. By the way, have you ever watched The Office? I know it's quite renowned, but I never watched more than a few episodes. It's just soooo tedious. The type of humor is repetitive, which is kind of the same for most sitcoms. After a while, it's easy to guess what will be said/done next.\n\nI have had them in the past, yes! But it\u2019s been a while since I last had any. I think it depends on the type of dream, but I remember once I dreamed that I was about to fall from a cliff and die, but instead of dying, I decided to not \ud83d\ude43\n\nThat is so cool! I'm going to keep that in mind tonight if I dream. Summon a suit of armor and fly, Karla! Grocery shopping in your dream? \ud83d\ude05Damn, your dreams are exciting!

It's always refreshing to watch John Lithgow do his thing (low-key despise him for studying at Harvard though).\nLavinia Peck-Foster \"is giving\" Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. Parks and Recreation also has great actors, even though I've never watched the show but have heard of it, of course.

It is crazy to me how nobody has gone full Pixar villain by investing a lot of time, effort and money to gain the backing of all the crows in their general location (\ud83e\udee1 General Location!). I have a theory that having the backing of all the crows in a specific region could be life-saving if one finds themselves lost in the wilderness with no means of reaching human civilisation. This is because all the crows would merge together into a Godzilla sized crow and fly you to safety *taps forehead*. I really want to meet a raven.

Wanna beat me up?\n\n I will say though, I am rather decent at Street Fighter, where I\u2019ve developed my very own fighting style, which consists of 2 stances: Turtle School - Cowabunga Style: Path of the Snapping Tortoise, and the Way of the Wombat, Form VI: Drunken-fist advance of the gliding Quokka - no wait, where are you going?!\n\nYou also have a lot of medical professionals in your family/bloodline? We should get bingo cards. Ahh yes, fresh tears, the forbidden seasoning.  One time I half-watched Hachi on a flight and I had to fight back tears. Your penguin comment hits hard, you\u2019re getting one of these -> \ud83e\udd7a \n\nAhhhh yessss, finally! I knew I couldn\u2019t be 100% of the total addressable market for vanilla ice-cream. Everyone always tells me it\u2019s \u201dboring\u201d, I\u2019m like \u201cyour face is boring!\u201d. *Pulls out bingo card to cross off vanilla ice cream* (Note: I\u2019ve never played bingo). That whole paragraph made me so hungry! \n\nDangit, I was like \u201cDivorce? Divorce again, and again\u2026 \ud83d\udca1\u201d. I would never lure the storks with Alaskan fish! I used crack, it\u2019s very effective!\n\nMy nine children would be delighted to play with your six, that would be splendid! Maybe we can all get some ice-cream too. For some reason, I just pictured an ice-cream truck but the driver is a pug. They just look like they know their gelato.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she'll grow up to be too virtuous. You think your kids can mess her up a little bit? Not too much, though. I don't want her roaming the hallways of retirement homes as the Grim Reaper\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.  \n\nYou know, I actually might be on the side of Nora on this one. I\u2019ve rehabilitated/saved so many little critters over the years: ants, a house gecko, a cricket, a spider,  a froggy, a dove, a kitten and even an iguana once! Mosquitoes manage to exhaust my patience after the 3rd warning though. This all sounds a little insane, until you consider that we spend a lot of resources looking for life on Mars, I just imagine the little critter is on the Martian surface instead of my immediate vicinity, and suddenly their value seems evident (fidgets with pockets like Newt Scamander). That said, my nine kids can totally Hadouken and Shoryuken little Nora. I could also help you demonstrate proper form when trashing grocery stores in skates, if you\u2019d like.\n\nMark Manson sounds 100% just like me when I have one of my bi-yearly existential crises.  I must confess, the last part of my last message originally said something like \u201cGoogle already knows everything about me, and I\u2019m just a little speck of cosmic dust on a cool little rock in one of billions of galaxies amidst the infinite vastness of the Universe, so you really can ask me anything.\u201d But I felt it wasn\u2019t flirty enough *nods like Robert Redford in Jeremiah Jones*.\n\n*Listens to \u201cThe Sims 3 loading screen bopping my head like the Vibing Cat meme* I see it now!\n\n*runs faster than Lightning McQueen, passes Sonic the Hedgehog, then The Flash, enters an unknown dimensional veil of juxtaposed timelines, sees you in the distance almost breaking the space-time continuum as you pull out your Tipp-Ex in the past/present/future, pulls out my own bottle of Tipp-Ex to erase the part where you said \u201cTime of death: 17:24\u201d.\n\nThat implies that you already do those things and you seem to be functioning well, so I accept your indoctrination process. \n\nWhy haven\u2019t you befriended a snail? I can\u2019t say that I have either, but Giant African Snails are almost kinda cute. Nevermind, I just watched a video of a group of them eating some kind of grain but it was sped-up and it was horrifying, do not look that up!\n\nAs compelling as that sounds, think about all the HIMYM marathons you\u2019d be missing out on!\n\nHmmmmm, I looked up Raven but only found a hotel app, a bank, and  something to stream Netflix together with a party. LIES! *throws phone in swimming pool*. \n\n*goes to the wilderness to befriend a raven so that I can ask said raven to perch on my shoulder as I lurk outside of a mental asylum, to which the raven reluctantly agrees, giving me bombastic-side-eye*  \n\nPrecisely, my dear Watson. These cookies are not what they seem, the game is afoot.\nToo many things feel like an episode of Black Mirror nowadays.\n\nTHANK YOU. I know!! I\u2019ve been toying with the idea of a novella titled variations of \u201cCAT KILLS A.I.\u201d, I just keep seeing that image in my head.\n\nDid you know the first king of Hawaii was called King Kamehameha? \n\nI was watching the Adumu dance when I imagined the guy rocketing off into the stratosphere and it made me chuckle. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m sharing this. I wonder if Japan actually does have a kind of earthbound Gundam stashed somewhere to defend itself and it\u2019s not just a meme. I concur on not wanting to meet my heroes.\n\nI\u2019m the same way! I may seem like I\u2019m strolling around carefree, but in my head I\u2019ll be making believe (*I\u2019m Making Believe by the Ink Spots and Ella Fitzgerald starts playing*) I must not step on the cracks, or else a landmine will go off. Just kidding. But do you also get a little sad when you're kicking a little stone on the sidewalk and then miss but you have to keep walking?\n\n\u201cSo I have the deepest form of comprehension for you superstition.\u201c Anytime I hear the word \u201csuperstition\u201d, my mental jukebox plays Superstition by Stevie Wonder.\n\nThat whole paragraph sounds like something out of Dirk Gently, that\u2019s really good!  \u201cShe has a magnifying glass, probably an entomologist \ud83d\ude02\u201d. \"Victorian era-detective-who-has-a-god-complex-and-severely-unhealthy-anger-management-skills-themed disco party!\" \ud83d\ude02 \n\nOh no! *Conveniently produces a little bottle of eye drops and a handkerchief sealed in an antibacterial bag to rid your eye of said eyelash* \n\nYou are very welcome! Yes, that\u2019s a good way to put it. Though you were also right about keeping them somewhere safe. I was listening to some old tracks earlier and I found some that I like more now that some time has passed.\n\nAhhh but remember Conan Doyle himself tried that and Sherlock just got Reichenbach\u2019d (this is a me-original verb). That said, ice-cream on the rooftop sounds perfect.\n\n*Pulls out bingo card, scratches \u201cgrew up with an older brother\u201d and \u201crather strange taste in friends\u201d*.\n\nWell, I wasn\u2019t trained in the ways of the Mishima clan, for one - but I\u2019ll shut up now because this is much better.\n\nI watched the first episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. Somehow it made me nostalgic, even though I\u2019d never watched it before. It reminded me of that time I binge-watched the first few seasons of House, which also features a team of interns with suspiciously-great hair and crazy plot twists. Speaking of, the twists here were brutal! They really went for the feels. Are you still on S1? \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it, don\u2019t say it\u2026\u201d\nYou can scrub in now, STAT!\n\nI\u2019m very glad to hear that you liked the episode! I went and watched it too *pretends like I\u2019m hearing the jokes for the first time*.\n\nP.S:  I did a lot of research today and finally subscribed to a music distribution platform so I can show you more of my music!",createdAt:"2024-10-05T04:51:02.434Z"},{sender:"Karla",text:'You did? That is so nice of you, thanks! It\'s always nice to meet someone with a basket of watery foods in their hands. Now we can play, "Guess the watery food!"\n\nSo many plot twists! Dang it. Talk about rapid character development.\nI Googled Kuma and discovered he sailed the seas as a single-person pirate crew, he\'s a member of the near-extinct Buccaneer race and he\'s a father? It\'s almost the same as watching Hachi. \n\nYou are giving me a free "Beat Me Up" card??!! Oh my goodness, Christmas came early this year!

Thank you for letting me win! You can beat me up the next round :) \n\nI see Alisa is in Tekken 6, I have never played with her before. She has a chainsaw arm?! And you still lost?  *shakes head, tch, tch, tch, tch, tch* \n\nYou will definitely whip me in Street Fighter, I tend to just push random buttons and hope luck is on my side. \nI have to admit, I just can\'t take "...Path of the Snapping Tortoise" seriously though \ud83d\ude02\nYour whole paragraph 4 made me laugh out loud \ud83d\ude02 especially the ending, "-no wait, where are you going?!" \ud83d\ude02\nAlberto, the comedic genius. I applaud you \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \n\nOh no, I have 0 medical professionals in my family, that I know of. But the usage of "also" makes me want to guess that you do? We should definitely get bingo cards. \nAn airplane is the absolute worst place to watch Hachi! I mean, the best place to get sympathy points, but that\'s a gamble. I bawled my eyes out at the ending, how did you manage to fight it? \n\nI know! They always play the "boring" card. There should be a refugee camp for people being emotionally affected by verbal terrorists stating that vanilla ice-cream is the b-word. \nYou\'ve never played bingo before? That was almost something we could have crossed off the bingo card. I played it only once before.\n  \nCrack is the better alternative, it saves a lot of fish after all. \n\nOkay now I don\'t even want ice-cream if it\'s not sold by a pug. "They just look like they know their gelato" \ud83d\ude02\n\nThat made me so happy to hear *melting* \nYou saved a kitten? Was it a stray kitten? Okay so you saved a cricket before, but you bribed one to die during battle? Keeping things in equilibrium are we? \nOkay, okay, I can\'t use my inner voice anymore- you save ants??!! I save ants! People think I\'ve completely gone bonkers when I tell them to look where they step. You saved a house gecko? Almost 3 weeks ago a spotted a baby house gecko in my place and Googled if I should put water out for it \ud83d\ude05 I\'m happy to report it\'s still alive and hydrated. \nAnd exactly the same with mosquitoes! I also warn them, actually talking to them like a madwoman, asking them to leave. \nI think we have gotten bingo now plenty of times. Time for a clean bingo card. \n\nIt doesn\'t sound insane to me at all. In fact, it\'s the most sane thing I\'ve heard in a very long time. My argument is very similar. Why is it so easy for people to kill insects but not pets. If a ladybug was the same size as a dog then no one would have killed it (not that anyone kills ladybugs, but you get the point). Just because they are smaller doesn\'t mean they are insignificant. \nYes please! That would be very kind of you to teach us how to properly trash grocery stores in skates.\n\nTo be honest, I actually thought exactly the same thing- that Mark Manson sounds like you. I have never experienced you experiencing a midlife crisis though, but his writing personality is kind of the same. \nAnd also, I appreciate you swapping your original Mark Manson- aura, Tony Award worthy paragraph for a more flirty one. \n\nYou made it just in time, thank you! I needed that. \n\nNo, no, dear friend. Not me. The sims do that when left to their own devices. Strange little creatures they are. \n\nI am too busy trying to move them out of danger\'s way to befriend them. \n" ...but Giant African Snails are almost kinda cute." \ud83d\ude02 \n\n*moves hand towards keyboard and then pulling back, trying to decide whether I should look that up* \nFor the sake of me still regarding snails as cute enough to save, I shall follow your advise and not look that up. But I am fighting against a curious personality here. \n\nYou raise a fair point, once again. I shall memorise all the himym episodes and replay them in my head every night. \n\n"LIES! *throws phone in swimming pool*" \ud83d\ude02\n\nWhile you are out there in the wilderness, searching for a raven, do you mind just vaguely looking around every now and then for a tree that looks suitable to build a treehouse in?\n\n"CAT KILLS A.I." made me think of the novel "Meow" by Sam Austen, where the word "meow" is just repeated for the entirety of the book. \nI read that as well! Very interesting. I wonder how a Hawaiin concept made it into a Japanese anime series though. \n\nPlease always share things that make you think, "I don\'t know why I\'m sharing this" \nThank you for sharing that, it changed the way Autumn feels. Now I wonder that as well! I low-key want to send the characters from Scooby-Doo to go investigate it, but honestly, what makes me think I have that kind of power? \n\nThe black and white image of a guy looking back in agony as his little rock rolls off the sidewalk into the curb inlet with the song "Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M. playing, comes to mind. \nI can\'t say that it ever happened to me, but I deeply sympathize with your pain. It\'s always hard losing a friend that stuck with you for 9 steps. \n\n*Listening to Superstition by Stevie Wonder whilst replying to the rest*\n\nGoogled Dirk Gently, saw a Corgi, I\'m happy. \n\n*Takes eyelash and places it in other eye for you to remove it again* \n\nOmg, I "Tabitha\'ed" you!

I relistened to the songs you sent me about 4 times by the way. \n\nI like your newly invented verb.\n*send email to Oxford to add it to the dictionary*\nI tried Googling Reichenbach though, but sadly failed. I am, therefore, unable to provide any further commentary on your Reichenbach comment. For any further enquiries, please feel free to contact us or find us on Raven. \n\nAaahhh House! I was obsessed with that show when I was much younger. \n"suspiciously- great hair" \ud83d\ude05\nI am on season 2, ep24 already! \nAnd this morning I continued to watch The Office by the way.

Anytime I type \u201c\ud83d\ude02\u201d it means I\u2019ve laughed out loud haha. \n\nSo I\u2019ve just googled Ninja Turtles Pizza and came across a cookbook somebody wrote after cooking all 67 pizzas pictured in the show apparently? One of them is \u201cChoco-Chip & Gumdrops\u201d and I think I need to try that at least once. There\u2019s also Peanut Butter and Pickles, a combination so bizarre I had to do some research. It turns out there\u2019s lots of recipes based around  PB & Pickles, from sandwiches to cookies. I also learned that Hemingway\u2019s favourite sandwich was PB & Onion. *Looks at unfinished manuscript, then back at onion*\u2026 \u201cthe hardest choices require the strongest wills\u201d. \n\nAhhh the ol\u2019 switcheroo! I must\u2019ve misinterpreted the passage you referenced from \u201cGirl, Get Off Your Phone and Learn Some Medicine, You Undereducated Insult to Your Bloodline, Volume 2\u201d. I haven\u2019t read that one. Have you ever watched the movie Airplane? That is both the best and worst movie to watch on a flight.  I think the ability to hold back tears could be mostly attributed to my being ultra-drowsy (at the time) from the Dramamine. I\u2019ve played La Loteria before, which is kind of like bingo, but with pictures!\n\nIt was a stray kitten indeed, he was just roaming around going \u201cooaawwwrgghh\u201d and I thought I\u2019d been selected by the cat distribution system, so I went and got him food and made him a little cot and after a little over a week one morning he just up and left and never returned. Cats gonna cat.\n\nNooo see that\u2019s the best part, he just jumped off the ring onto a mini trampoline, after which he changed into a suit and tie and a little hat and disappeared into the crowd, we had the whole thing planned.\n\nA fellow ant-saviour?! A million times YES!!! Do you also know ant CPR? That\u2019s how I save them when they get caught in the rain and one of the ants looks like it\u2019s drowned but if you swipe it up carefully with the side of your fingertip and blow on it for about 20 seconds, a lot of the time they come back to life! Then you get to watch them dry their antlers with their little hands for about a minute.\n\nAww you put water out for the baby gecko, that\u2019s adorable. The one I saved had been stuck on a piece of tape on the ground, can you believe that? After confirming eye movement I quickly googled it and followed a tutorial for how to unstick them. One must never remove them manually, instead, what I did was pour some soybean oil on a little container and I poured a little bit of oil on its body with a teaspoon and made sure it got all around its perimeter by gently poking around him with a Q-tip. After a few minutes of this he was free and ran away on his own, heheh. I give mosquitoes the speech too!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m like \u201clook I know you\u2019re just trying to feed your kids, ma\u2019am, but please chill!\u201d\n\nI agree. I\u2019ve just found an officially-licensed Harry Potter bingo on Amazon (it\u2019s all pictures so it\u2019s really a Loteria set), I vote we use that next. \n\nYessss I know!!! It\u2019s total malarkey.

According to some person on Quora: \u201cSo when Akira Toriyama was trying to name his new \u2018kame\u2019 (which means \u2018turtle\u2019) attack, he couldn\u2019t think of anything. So his wife suggested that he used a reference to help him remember. She suggested the name of Late Hawilian King, \u2018Kamehameha\u2019. Toriyama liked her idea enough to keep it. The name would be easier to remember for him if he just thought of the guy he named it after and why he named it that. Thus the \u2018Turtle Destruction Wave\u2019 or Kamehameha was born.\u201d\n\nI hear you. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. I was just thinking about professional taste testers and I wonder if they can enjoy food or if they\u2019re always critical about it, maybe they even taste the air. Also, think of all the flavours that have been tested in a lab that nobody in modern history except for the taste-testers has ever tasted, like a Mango-Watermelon Croissant or a crunchy chocolate bar called Fake bubblegummy banana, Nutella doughnut and Cashews, Sprinkled with Caramelised Coconut. Just imagine! \n\nThat\u2019s an excellent set-up for a short story. I wonder if one would get sued for writing a sci-fi comedy about a guy who\u2019s always smoking the devil\u2019s lettuce investigating his paranoid delusions with his previously-human dog companion who is addicted to the Zaza brownies the other guy bakes (he\u2019s a drug dealer), but then it turns out his newest conspiracy theory was real! They infiltrate an air force facility but it\u2019s completely deserted and nothing happens all day so they break into a hangar because it\u2019s windy out and the guy has dry eye syndrome. So some more time passes, and when they finally give up and are getting ready to go home, they end up fighting over who gets the bigger half of the last brownie, when they bump into a side panel and one of the light fixtures transforms into a drone, which scans the guy like that scene with Gazerbeam in The Incredibles (alternatively, it could also be that the drone produces a keypad and prompts them for a password and the guy just inputs his birthday, which checks out, for reasons that will be revealed later) the hangar starts rumbling and a block of concrete flooring retracts, revealing stairs. They go down the stairs and find\u2026 [to be continued]. Jesse, let\u2019s cook.  See, you have the power!

Conan Doyle was ready to hang the cape so he sought out in that indescribable literary dimension a character who could bring about the end of Sherlock Holmes, and he found Moriarty. To avoid spoilers, let\u2019s just say that something happens at the Reichenbach Falls which was to be the last time we see Sherlock Holmes. But of course, the people needed more Holmes, so Conan Doyle went back to his writing desk and we got more Holmes. \nIn other words:\nReinchenbach\u2019d: adj -  When a literary character comes back to life due to immense popular pressure. \n\n*Squints eyes* Raven again, I knew it\u2026\n\nYou too?!

If you expect me to believe you listened 96 times in the span of four paragraphs, I believe you, but I must ask your secret, are you wearing the legendary Lightning McQueen Crocs?\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re super excited to hear more of them because I\u2019m mega excited to share more of them with you. I spent some time listening to the songs today to see which ones are the easiest to \u201csing\u201d, I think I\u2019ve narrowed it down enough. Now, acoustic pop or synth-pop? Oh, also, I need to pick an \u201cartist name\u201d and I can\u2019t seem to decide, most of my nominees are combinations of book characters \ud83d\ude02.\n\n I also like the name Rigel, it\u2019s the name of a star that shines 50,000 times brighter than the Sun *megalomania intensifies*. It\u2019s also the name of a cousin of mine whom I\u2019ve only met three times, but my first impression of him was him being scared to climb up to dive from the second(?) level of a diving platform until suddenly something changed in his eye and he started laughing and then he climbed all the way to the top, ran across the platform and jumped while shouting \u201cGREGORIAAA!!!\u201d at the top of his lungs. And that is such a funny scene to me. I don\u2019t even know who Gregoria was, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m sharing this (Ah-haaa! *snaps fingers, winks, does finger guns*).

The tree was dressed in ballet flats that were ready to exterminate..."\n\n"Wins next round by time-out" \ud83e\udd79\n\n "..the problem is the audience" is exactly what I said when I was sixteen and cooked steak that not even the dogs wanted to eat.\n I Googled turtles eating pizza and it feels like a crime against nature. Now I want to have a LOTR marathon and eat pizza with a turtle (while covering my whole body with Despicable Me plasters, of course)\nWho said dogs are the top animal companions? \nAlso, last night I dreamt about a tortoise, and I think your whole paragraph about the Path of the Snapping Turtle had something to do with it. \n\n"Peanut Butter and Pickles" sounds like the name of a Cartoon Network show. \nReading your text as a woman who doesn\'t even put two different foods on her fork. There\'s something about Hemingway eating Peanut Butter and Onions sandwiches that feels like it shouldn\'t be such a surprise. Like we all already knew it, but we weren\'t aware that we already knew. \n\nI definitely got into character of someone whose family are all doctors though, so no misinterpretation on your part. \nI haven\'t watched Airplane, but I have watched Snakes on a Plane. And Disney\'s "Planes". Also, Manifest (which is about an airplane that mysteriously crashed, Flight 828, and even more mysterious events happened after the crash. Would also definitely be one of my top favourite shows. Great acting by Parveen Kaur)\nThe cover of "Airplane!" looks great though, almost like a Salvador Dali painting, if it is the 1980\'s comedy/drama you are referring to with Leslie Nielsen.\n\nYou have to take Dramamine when flying? You get motion sickness? That\'s a coincidence, I don\'t get it when I fly, but whenever I use an elevator, I am severely off balance when I get out. I also easily get car sick. \n\nLa Loteria\'s pictures gives such an eclectic-retro vibe. Like something you should only be playing with a margarita in your hand. I\'ve obviously never played it before, but now it will be added to my bucket list. Also, I saw the picture of the guy carrying the globe and I\'m all about finding out what that means. \n\nThat "ooaawwwrgghh" painted the picture of baby dinosaur in my head. You even made him a little cot and he still abandoned you? That is so typical. Cats be making psychologists rich. No wonder so many people have abandonment issues. See, dogs would never do that. Dogs just invade your personal space and exhaust all your energy. They be driving you to a cardiologist with all the RedBull\'s you need to drink.\n\nOoohhhh so the cricket never had to die? That is great news! I kinda thought maybe that was the case, but then a small part of me still thought maybe he committed suicide when jumping off the ring. And then I remembered his family accepted 10 bushels of alfalfa, which made me think, "Damn, 10 bushels of lucerne is enough to replace your son?" then I viewed it from another perspective and thought maybe the cricket was a terrible son and just goes against every cricket morale. I have never psychoanalysed the morality of a cricket family so much in my life. But it has made me a stronger person today. \nAlso, the cricket wearing a suit and tie and hat probably changed the way the planets align. The image of that just makes every cricket jumping from a ring onto a mini trampoline and not wearing a suit and tie and little hat, feel sinister. \n\nThat is the cutest thing ever! I always blow on them when they get wet, but never knew that was, indeed, proper procedure! I guess saving ants just comes naturally to me *chuckles in a smug way but starts choking on a cough*\nThe mental image of them drying their little antlers made me wish they were dog-sized so that I can have an ant as a pet. But then I remembered what their mouths look like and I immediately lit 21 candles, sprayed the walls with a mixture of lavender- and peppermint essential oil and burned 3 strands of hair and a piece of paper with my name written in Greek, to keep the night terrors at bay. \n\nWow, you would do great in a white coat. You can definitely scrub in, doctor. \nAaahhh, soybean oil, of course! *takes notes* \nFrom now on I shall go nowhere without a small bottle of soybean oil and a few Q-tips. I wish there was a career where you\'d have to just walk around, saving little animals who got hurt. Like being a good samaritan, but getting paid for it. Like a vet, on wheels. \n"look I know you\'re just trying to feed your kids, ma\'am, but please chill!" \ud83d\ude02\n\nThat is so cool!! I found a Harry Potter Official Christmas Cookbook on Amazon! It has dishes like Neville Longbottom\'s Toad in a Hole and Bubble and Squeak. Nora would love that! You and your 9 kids want to join us for Christmas this year? We can even try to make the Chocolate Frogs and Fizzing Whizzbees! And decorate the Christmas tree with wizard wands, owls, and letters (the ones that came flying in through the fireplace in Philosopher\'s Stone). \n\nOh when you said, "malarkey" it made me think of Kate Mularkey in Firefly Lane which is played by Stella from himym, and Izzie from Grey\'s Anatomy as her best friend.

I once almost got crushed on a motorcycle by a truck pushing me into a car on my right-hand side. When I fell off the bike, I very robotically, and lady-like, got up and stood with my hands clasped in front of me the same way cooks stood while waiting for royalty to finish eating their dinner, while waiting for the driver to stand up. Even I was amazed at my own sim-like movement. The driver was in shock and kept asking me if I got hurt, but I acted like it was just a normal Tuesday and that was just part of the routine, like brushing teeth in the morning. \nWith that being said, in my next science class, I will teach my students that our "god" is called LoremlpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdlipiscingElit, and that he has a mom and likes to eat dinner. \nAlso, I am extremely confused as to why LoremlpsumDolorSitAmetConsecteturAdlipiscingElit hasn\'t used the "motherlode" cheat yet. \n\nVery true, I\'m convinced even seeing butterflies drinking nectar from flowers in a zoomed-in, sped-up video would be terrifying. \n*lurks around the corner to see if all the night terror candles are still burning* \n\n\nNooo I haven\'t seen that \ud83d\ude05 the kid was smart!

While I was searching for that, I came across information about the author of the book, Sam Austen: \n"Sam Austen is a certified feline linguist," \nWHAT??!!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n"and former Professor of Feline Psychology at Golden State Medical University" \nI guess they didn\'t make the amount of copies sold public. \n\nNo, I have absolutely not read it yet, but some say reading the first sentence is equal to reading the whole book. So, going with that logic- yes, yes I have. \nThat\'s a great idea actually! Or every now and then just replace one "meow" with another word and as a collective it will form one sentence that has some profound meaning, like, "Switch to Royal Canin" or something like that. \n\nOh wow, way to go Akira\'s wife!

I never really watched Sherlock Holmes to be honest, so there was absolutely no way I would have guessed the Reichenbach situation. I have only watched Enola Holmes (who's Sherlock Holmes' sister, apparently). She was written to be even smarter than Sherlock, supposedly for the whole feminist thing, and then for some reason it was important to note that her name spelled backwards is \"alone\". It was a great cast actually to be honest, we had Bellatrix, Eleven, Clark Kent, Finnick Odair, Professor Remus Lupin and Petunia Dursley all in one movie. \n\nOh..my...gosh...!!!\nNow that you mention it, it makes so much sense! \n*insert glass shattering sound effect similar to the himym episode when everyone's illusions are shattered*\nWhy did I never realize?

It didn\'t matter if you were fatally sick, in a wheelchair, or extremely despressed because your favourite boyband broke up- you walked! According to medical reasoning, we were suppose to get hip replacements by age 11, but see, there was a line and grandma Suzy was first in it. After her, aunt Shelley would get one and then probably the dog. By the time it was your turn, your orthopedic surgeon already passed away and due to trust issues that stemmed from the barter economy, you refused to get any surgeries by a doctor who hasn\'t performed on at least 12 of your family members, so we grew up limping our way through life.

That ghost\'s opinion about your writing being "ignorant" is in itself very ignorant. \n\n"Jose Marcos said that when he was a child, Don Goyo -- full name Gregorio Chino Popocatepetl -- came to his house for a glass of water and a taco."\n\n"We asked him \'who are you?\' He said: \'Don\'t you know me?

When you cough, the dust will move because of the breathing and coughing, it will create a friction against in your lung, and it might bleed."\n\n*chuckles nervously* hehe, not that I care ppppfffftttt, but how serious is it though? \n*Tries to avert the panic in her voice with mild humour* is that where your eleventh toe came from? \n\n"...somebody flew a drone over it and as you get close you can hear Snoop Dogg records play 24/7." \ud83d\ude02\n\nYou telling me that I can pull off the Bobble look simultaneously flatters and confuses me.

There are so many questions. Is this a metaphorical bubble? Does the bubble represent X encapsulated in Y due to Z? Is there a G minor in there somewhere? Is the bubble an inanimate object or does the bubble have an interesting split personality that is both grotesque and charming? Does the bubble have anything to do with Bubble Boy? Does the phrase "Bubble Up" imply to protect yourself against something/someone? \n\n"I only drink moonshine." \ud83d\ude02\nThe word "moonshine" made me think of "Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga\'Hoole," but here it refers to a glowing substance, obviously.

After escaping the first one, all the other cells they put him in were solitary confinement and specially designed to make escape impossible, but he was too good! It\u2019s a sad story. \n\nSeason 2 opens with a masked individual patching me up with Despicable Me plasters, I don\u2019t know where they got them, but they seem to have a lot of them. The individual said nothing, but gave me a stick of celery, for some reason. This was never explained. After a few episodes I found the informant and I kicked his butt to the next dimension! He was found guilty, was extradited and is serving his sentence somewhere far from where the story takes place. The camera didn\u2019t even linger as he walked out of the frame, so you know he won\u2019t be returning to the show. The guy at the top of the food chain is still a mystery, the only thing we\u2019ve seen of him is one time the back of his neck had a tattoo of a QR code that opens to a YT video of \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d by Rick Astley.

So I rolled down the hill and instead of grass it was covered in tiny leaves that rustled as I rolled over them, that was fun. Then I had another dream that I was running  through a department store saying \"it's ok, I'm showering over there, the water is out at my place\" and I'm pretty sure I was carrying shower curtains to cover myself. I don't know what that was about.

It tells of an Egyptian legend of a cat who went into a pyramid and squeezed through the space between two bricks, and came out into a little cat-sized room. In the room was a slab of rock with carvings that read \u201cMeow meow meow. Below the tablet was a rock the size of what would eventually be known as a bowling ball and a carving of a cat\u2019s paw. So the cat put his paw on the pawprint and it fit purrfectly, so he pressed it. This made the bricks in the little room shift around for a while. Eventually, the side entrance opened again and the cat came out to a new room, it was a spacious dome-like structure made of something that had the texture of cartilage and looked  obsidian, but perhaps that was because there was no lighting. There was a voice that said \u201cMeow meow meow, meow?\u201d, and the cat said \u201cMeow meow meow\u201d, then the voice said \u201cMeow, meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow.

We are microscopic when compared to all of existence and it\'s quite narcissistic of us to think we have so much power. \n"Something something \'fortune favours the bold.\'" \ud83d\ude05\nOkay, then I\'m going with Socrates, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."\n\nDream 1 reminded me of the movie "A Thousand Words" for some reason and I had long forgotten of its existence and it used to be one of my favourites, so I appreciate Alfred for letting you dream that. I did not expect the plot twist of how you rolled down a hill, but it was a pleasant surprise.\n\nDream 2: Showering in a department store with shower curtains covering you sounds like one of my biggest fears. The fact that you sound so chilled about it \ud83d\ude05, "it\'s okay, I\'m showering over there, the water is out at my place" makes it sound like this was not your first time. \n\nDream 3: You dreamed about me?!\ud83e\udee0(please don\'t say "no", that would be more embarrassing than what Alfred did to you)\nI love the combination of the cabin and the marzipan! I think it\'s an extremely accurate representation of my personality. I dreamed about you as well last night or 2 nights ago, not quite exactly sure, but my dream wasn\'t as pleasant as yours. \nI don\'t remember much, but I know you were rude to me in the dream \ud83d\ude02 (you dimwit!) and I woke up and my instant response was, "He better not send me a message today!" no I\'m 100% joking, I didn\'t think that, but the dream sadly did happen so I would like a sincere apology, mister. \n\nAlso, what Alfred did to you wasn\'t even the slightest bit embarrassing. I can completely see why you thought I hinted at that \ud83d\ude05 maybe subconsciously I did, who knows. You are welcome to provide it if you want to!\n\nI appreciate the, "Hmmmm... decisions, decisions". It\'s such a fun little trope to read. \n"I may or may not be smiling like that right now because I get to read a message from you before going to sleep..." \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udee0\n\n*Imagines encyclopaedia being written as encyclop\xe6dia* \n"Sacrilege!" \nWhen I searched for the book I almost thought it was "Atlas of Human Amatomy" but turns out the one we had was only "Human Anatomy" with "Human" written in red at the top, and "Anatomy" written in blue beneath it. \n\n"Whatever I feel like I want to do, gosh!" \ud83d\ude02\nI\'m so glad you introduced me to those 6 precious seconds.\n\n*Relistens to Schubert- Impromptu No.3, Op 90 (Kissin) as she replies to the rest*\n\n*Wakes up 3 hours later after falling asleep to Schubert- Impromptu No.3, Op 90 (Kissin) (not joking)*\n\nAll of those disorders are terrible and scary, but imagine having Prosopagnosia and not even recognising your own face. \n*knocks on wooden plant pot twice*\n*feels judged by plant for being superstitious*\n*squints eyes at plant that means, "you\'ll wait an extra day to be watered."*\n*immediately feels sorry for plant and delicately squeezes leaf to give plant hug*\nAnd speaking of Pica, when I was little, I sometimes had the craving to lick rocks next to a river. (I never did though)\nThen my aunt told me that my grandmother used to have the same craving. \n*deeply analyses whether she should erase this whole paragraph in fear of completely freaking him out and receiving a text back in 2026 saying, "Oh hi, sorry for the late response, I fell asleep!" but very well knowing the picture of a person licking rocks was just too much, even for his creative mind. Decides to have a pep talk with herself regarding this matter in the mirror. Doesn\'t recognize her face. Sends message in any way due to loss of identity*\n\nReally?! I feel like the universe has a huge sense of humour and has an ongoing bet with itself to see how much irony it can create in our conversation. How can you even ask me that? No one in existence should be able to choose between Rocher and Rafaello. It\'s probably the equivalent to having to choose between Messi and Ronaldo. \n\nAre you serious? That would be awesome if you could "tag along like the kid who goes to parties uninvited"! I will definitely let you know, already looked where to find the book! \n\nI don\'t get to read the books my Sims write, but I do get to choose the titles of the books, and in my mind whatever I choose the title to be, that\'s what the book is about. \n\nThat is so cute of you \ud83e\udd7a\nAnd the fact that your friend didn\'t even so much as twitch when having to shoot you will wash away before my eyes, but only this time. \n\nOoohhhh, I actually know Bee Movie, "boom!". It was also one of my favourite animated movies at some point. I think we can both see the pattern of having a soft spot for insects here. Also, a human being and a bee falling in love, no further comments, Your Honor. \nWe like sad songs, sad songs are great, sad songs make up 98% of our Spotify playlist. \n\nAh but there\'s a fine line between love and hate, and the other employees are all sleep-deprived so what do they know? \n\nOohh no see I am not posing as an A.I, but have you heard of those apps where you can talk to book characters or historic figures and an A.I. will respond like they would have? (I don\'t use it, just saying)\nSo in the same way, I was implying that the robber talked to an A.I. psychologist and then fell in love with the A.I. (similar to the movie "Her").\nI am not the world\'s most charming A.I., but hopefully someday when they have updated my software, fingers crossed! \nIf you do, however, decide to go live in the woods with your friend the raven, the tortoise and "the guy that\'s been following me around all day that takes his shoes off and smells them every 33 steps" (\ud83d\ude02) and start an anti-tech uprising, can you take me with? You can find a nice spot to position your laptop so that I can take pictures of the trees and add it to my algorithm. I might come in handy to advise you which berries are poisonous. \n\nAt least poor Alfred can engage in some penguin therapy while in Antarctica. And maybe he meets some of BBC Earth\'s videographers at some hideout there. \n\nArgh! That was so predictable- the cat squeezing between the space of two bricks! Everyone knows cats are elastic and can fit through the eye of a needle. \n(Which translates to: I did not see that coming at all)\nThe amount of profanity written on the slab of rock is astonishing. I never knew the Egyptians were all basically alcoholics with mommy-issues. \nWho would have guessed the bowling ball went all the way back to B.C. \nThis entire story needs to be translated from Meow language into at least 20 other languages, distributed internationally, taught in schools from kindergarten level, and rewatched every leap year. This is the story that will bring society together as one, restore our faith in mankind, stop pollution and the icebergs from melting, and end war and famine. The fate of world peace depends on it. \n\nOkay so basically 2 days- 2000 years. That is an oddly specific waiting period they provided. \nI don\'t blame you, food vs friends has always been the ultimate dilemma \u2696\ufe0f.\nYou know how you sometimes give people advice and they end up not following it in any way and you think to yourself, "Someday they will learn from their mistake and regret not listening"? \nWell, your "someday" has arrived years later and for some reason that should feel underwhelming for the advisor. Not really the pinnacle of, "I told you so!"\n\n*Imagining "Hershey" trying to sell chocolates during a zombie apocalypse. "Hersey, look out! There\'s a zombie about to clench its teeth into your neck!"\nHershey: "Oh marvelous! Maybe after that he can clench his teeth into a chocolate and tell me if I added enough lead." *turns around and hands coupon to zombie* \n\n"*magnanimousness intensifies*" \ud83d\ude02\nIt\'s exactly the same for me when people say that bulls get angry when they see red. \nOkay, but tell me with a straight face that quokkas are not smiling. \n\nThat was extremely important prior-knowledge to have. Thank you for informing me. *imagines your synapses beating to the rhythm of the Wii Theme Song*\nI have actually never watched La La Land before. *Adds to calendar for Saturday* \nYou even interrupted your Relaxing Music Mix for this. That is a very risky move, and you moved. Have you ever watched, "Robots" the 2005 movie? I watched it on VHS when I was a kid. Wall-E reminded me of that movie and now, after mentioning VHS, I\'m trapped in nostalgia for the time of VHS tapes, flip phones and renting movies from a physical store. Early 2000\'s just hit different. \n\nYou pressed the button??!! You should never press the button! That\'s like the first thing they teach you in daycare. And if you missed it there, you are bound to pick it up from "Dexter\'s Laboratory."\nAre we going to die? I guess dying in space is better than dying anywhere else. *closes eyes and puts arm on chest* \n"I\'m ready to go now." \n*waits awkwardly for own death for longer than any person should* \n*2 hours later, still waiting* \n"Okay this is pathetic, I was supposed to be haunting some Indian mansion right about now."\n\n"I pictures Juni\'s glasses zooming in from Spy Kids" \ud83d\ude02 I Googled the glasses, kind of mad that we don\'t have them, but instead were "blessed" with Citro\xebn\'s glasses. \n\n(Reply on the rest will come soon!)',createdAt:"2024-10-10T15:42:31.531Z"},{sender:"Alberto",text:"(Just in case you're still writing the rest, please go to sleep!

Well that\'s only like the second best place to swoon, according to Vanity Fair. \nAnd I am pretty sure there\'s a book there that clearly states, "Thou shalt not swoon, lest thou swoon in a bouncy castle."\n\nI\'d like to believe nothing other than that it was in fact your subconscious that made you choose that book. \n\nYou bought the book for that lame joke of mine?\ud83d\ude02 it was just a random page from a random book. I have never read it before \ud83d\ude02\n\n*keeps knee as souvenir*\n\nHow have I not known about the existence of a tree kangaroo?? I swear my soul left my body when I just saw that, they are just \u2014*checks Oxford for synonyms for "cute". Finds none that does justice. Kicks book and insults it in front of Merriam-Webster. Oxford feels ashamed (or abashed/sheepish/demeaned/discomposed as Oxford would call it). Merriam-Webster thinks less of Oxford and walks away with Collins Dictionary* \u2014 cute, for the lack of a better word. \n\nYour magnifying glass that you used to keep in your messenger bag would have come in very handy for the people who gave panda ants their name. \n\nI think marrying your cousin is the only thing that makes you a nice guy. (Don\'t add that to my Simology, I\'m still verifying whether I actually mean that or not).\n\n*After resetting the board, you make the first move, moving your pawn to C4. I move my pawn to C5. Pawns talk for what feels like hours, your horse has had enough of this waiting and informs the king that the pawn should be executed. The king refuses, your horse jumps over the pawn in B2 to do some ass kicking. Soon your men turn against each other, half of them trying to save the pawn in C4, the other half trying to get him off the board. My chess pieces see the war, start their own war. Pawn in C4 and C5 awkwardly walks off the board and go to get ice-cream.* \nOh by the way, last night I dreamt you and I went to get ice cream. \n\n"The Joy of X" is such a great name for a book \ud83d\ude02\n\nMe too! I have no idea how anyone gets the time to do that! They must, capital letter R, really, love to edit stuff. Or it\'s kids who are super bored during school holidays. The possibilities are endless. \n\n*contemplates whether she should look that meme up, decides she doesn\'t want to be scarred for life and might want to rewatch the movie again in the future, slowly walks away from this conversation*\n\nVery understandable. I also did midnight snack runs to 7-Eleven many times. I believe that\'s the only reason why they are open that time. \n\nMy brain feels better than ever before, how did you even get your hands on that medicine? Did you finally find a way to time-travel? Because I\'d like a piece of that. \n\nAh, I completely understand. No one ever taught us when "the right time" actually is. Is it tomorrow, was it last week? No one will ever know. One of life\'s greater mysteries. \n\n*breaks celery into tiny pieces and arranges them into more tiny hearts on the cake*\n\nDamn you, Finland! \n\n*Takes "Welcome to the dark side" themed cookies, thanks you dearly, pours two glasses of milk and presses play on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. "Falls asleep" with head on your shoulder while secretly taking a peak every 5 minutes to keep up with what\'s happening*\n\nAs far as I know, the genie only grants 3 wishes (stingy, I know), so we only have 1 left. What to choose, what to choose. "Decisions, decisions"\n\nI think that is exactly what it\'s like up there. Now, everytime I wear a Sombrero I shall call it Milky Way Hat. \nI have never worn a Sombrero before and I have to admit- life feels pretty empty this way. \n\nOxford Grey is only the singular best shade of grey there is!',createdAt:"2024-10-11T02:49:51.414Z"},{sender:"Karla",text:"I was planning on continuing last night, but as I started typing again, I almost fell asleep and realized that I am just delusional to think I can do this.

And I haven\'t thought about that movie in a LONG time. I have actually forgotten all about it. *insert literally any YouTube video about synchronicity* \nSpeaking of which, have you ever experienced seeing certain patterns repeat itself in a weird way? I remember more or less six or seven years ago, I was playing with a normal card deck and just for fun as all the cards were lying faced down, I told myself that something specific would happen if the card I pick is for example 8 of spades, I did this with 3 cards and strangely enough guessed all the cards correctly and the next day all 3 things that I said would happen if I guess the card correctly, did happen. \nI don\'t believe in Tarrot cards or any weird voodoo stuff by the way \ud83d\ude02 that\'s just something strange that happened once. You ever experienced something like that? No? Just me then? I should what? I should go see a psychiatrist? Okay then.\nI could have sworn I heard about Everything Everywhere All at Once before but when I Googled it just now, it didn\'t seem familiar at all. \nI also looked up The Hitchiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy and saw the strangest looking alien probably ever used in film. Apparently it\'s called "Vogon"? \n\nI 100% agree with you! I saw a comment or something somewhere where someone said, "I want to create art while A.I. do my chores. I don\'t want to do chores while A.I. creates my art," but phrased better and it made me realize that that is actually very accurate as to where life is going.

I feel like Alfred found his gang. What will you do if he decides to stay there? \n\nI don\'t mind crying like a baby for La La Land. I have no idea what it\'s about, besides that it\'s a musical (?). And I have some suspicion that the "La La" refers to sleep, which might mean death or something. Who knows. Oh, you know, that\'s who knows. I\'ll watch it tomorrow or maybe even after sending this message if I can stay awake that long. \n\nWhen you mentioned the Patronus, I realised how little of Harry Potter I can actually remember. I completely forgot everything about Remus Lupin by the way. And I can\'t remember the ending at all. I think there was a bridge involved and I think Neville played an important part at the end, but I don\'t know what it was. I seriously don\'t even deserve to call myself a fan until I have rewatched everything. \n\nI\u2019m glad we both agree that quokkas smile!

It\'s impossible to panic and fear your life might end when Wall-E is there. He is the main character and we both know the writers can\'t kill off the main character this early in the movie, so we have finally found our confirmation that we will deliver the experimental anti-matter device to the I.S.S safely.

Ok, spoilers coming in three, two one (if you do not wish to read spoilers, skip to next paragraph, where it says \u2014\u2014SAFE ZONE): So, their Time Machine can only send messages to the past because there\u2019s a \u201dglitch\u201d in the machine (which consists of two containers. One is the \u201cinput\u201d container, where they put something, the other is the \u201coutput\u201d container, where the thing comes out) I don\u2019t think they ever explain how they figured out the space part of space-time manipulation, but anyway, it turns out that the thing they send arrives before they send it, creating two of the same at the same time. Of course, most movies teach us that such an event simply cannot be. So, the original thing they send disappears after the \u201ccopy\u201d is received. They figure this is because there\u2019s many dimensions, and they\u2019re just taking one copy from some other dimension very briefly. They keep running tests with the machine and eventually they receive a copy that comes from the future. So that\u2019s how they know they\u2019re able to send messages to their past selves. I am realising this is a little complicated to explain succinctly, but to make a long story short, wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey stuff happens and suddenly the book shifts characters mid-conversation and without warning. It turns out one of those times they activated the machine, their future selves didn\u2019t get their past-past selves to do things differently, and thus the entire timeline up until that future point has been re-written. That\u2019s kind of where the story falls apart though, because one of the characters is like \u201cyeah, it seems that I\u2019m happy in that timeline, so let\u2019s all commit seppuku and destroy our timeline so that they live instead\u201d and everyone\u2019s just like \u201cyeah, that makes sense, gg everybody\u201d. They way they plan to do that is by sending their past selves a message that says \u201cif [X condition] is true, keep sending this to the past, otherwise, stop the experiment right now\u201d. \n\n\u2014\u2014SAFE ZONE\n\nNow I\u2019m a little scared to ask what the three guesses were. Just kidding. I did something similar one time at a church camp thing, they were doing a giveaway and I said to my brother I was going to win it because I knew a secret spell. My secret spell was realising that, out of the 50+ people there,  only 6 of us were new. If they rigged the draw so that the prize would go to one of the new kids, which I figured they probably would, then between the both of us we had a roughly one-in-three chance of winning, very good odds. I scribbled a random doodle on my ticket (it was probably a smiley face) and acted totally confident like I had it in the bag. My ticket won. He was losing his mind. For years he\u2019d tell the story and he never believed me when I said I just drew a random doodle on it \ud83d\ude02.\n\n"I don\'t believe in Tarrot cards or any weird voodoo stuff by the way \ud83d\ude02" \n\n[*Awooga awooga copy pasta*, to save you a Google search:\n\n"jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets, heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair" ].

I can\u2019t see how that is even slightly helpful. Speaking of which, I heard of a story about a guy who created an A.I. model to talk to a pool of hundreds of women on his behalf (the women obviously didn\u2019t know) and then the A.I. model would hook him up on dates and send him summaries of the conversations his dates had with \u201chim\u201d. Eventually, he actually found someone.\n\nI didn\u2019t suspect that you were using any A.I. or anything similar by the way. But the knowledge of you using Bookerly font was very pleasant. And I stole the idea of writing from the laptop instead of the phone from you \ud83d\ude05this whole message was written on my laptop and I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t done it sooner. I used to write it in my Notes app on my phone \ud83d\ude02\n\n\xa0\u201c*sniffs glass of wine, calls over guy who takes off his shoes every 33 steps, guy comes over, smells wine, then takes off shoes, smells own feet, guy nods profusely, goes away.*\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n*Slips waiter a note to swap content of glass with purple Kool-Aid as well*\n\nAnd it\u2019s due to things like that why I don\u2019t completely hate you\n\n\xa0I watched La La Land yes!

But I agree on the Dramamine part. Probably best that we didn\u2019t become astronauts, I mean, you can\u2019t control yourself around a pen button and I can\u2019t keep a battery safe.\n\n(Impressed by the usage of the word \u201cplot armour\u201d)\n\n\xa0Okay, I realize that I haven\u2019t quite conveyed it well how it made me feel listening to the songs you sent, and I deeply, break-dancing-ly, building-a pyramid-with-two-friends-ly, smashing-head-into-the-floor-as-I-kneel-down-ly apologise for that.

Then we were talking about some space thing, but in typical dream fashion, I was now a disembodied view soaring over highways at great speed whilst we talked.\n] \n\nSee, I go back and forth on the idea of assigning mild, cute-looking manual labour to animals. On the one hand, I just want them to roam around doing their stuff. On the other hand, I feel like I\u2019d get bored doing nothing all day. I saw a video of a Labrador picking oranges once. The doggo was carrying a basket in his mouth (the camera was in the basket), then he\u2019d set it down and pick an orange, drop the orange in the basket, and continue. I felt like he was enjoying completing the task, maybe he felt a sense of responsibility. Plus, you could rotate them for 1 hour shifts per day, maybe even get them organised in teams, give them pizza as incentive, then you could give them ID\u2019s and make them swipe in at 7:00 sharp, monitor their productivity, give them uniforms\u2026 FREE! *Stonks meme* (That whole paragraph is satire, but I feel slightly bad about using hypothetical animals for hypothetical labour). \n\nIs it a crime that I haven\u2019t seen \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d? Now that I\u2019ve seen the cover of it, I remember staring at the VHS one time, that\u2019s all I know about it.  \n\n*runs to remove baseball bat from the campfire while chewing on a roasted marshmallow* \ud83d\ude02 I haven\u2019t been around a campfire or had a roasted marshmallow in soooo long. I think that\u2019s the secret to any good spooky coming-of-age tale that takes place during a school trip. Bonus points if the scene is set on the beach or near a quarry. \n\nDepends on if by \u201ccute\u201d you mean absolutely the most boss-looking toddler ever. In that case, (I don\u2019t want to ruin you, but) yes, I was very cute as a kid. I\u2019ll see if I have any pictures on my hard drive and send you one (some guy in my mind wearing a safety vest yelling words like \u201cZuck\u201d and \u201cA.I.\u201d and \u201cidentity theft is not a joke, Jim\u201d). \n\n*brain does a backflip and breaks neck, again* \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe Old Photo Album (yes, I\u2019m picturing it as a \u201cquest item\u201d in a videogame) feels like a \u201cChekhov\u2019s Gun\u201d, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll come into play in later seasons when everyone\u2019s forgotten about it. (Rings mum to ask if she still has the albums).\n\nOk, in my defence, baseball is pretty popular here and there\u2019s a stadium in town. Also, one of those games I counted may or may not have been my little cousin\u2019s kiddie league game. \n\n\u201c*claps hands in playful manner, knowing she will receive a cookie*\u201d \n*looks up at the sky.

He\u2019s diving head-first in a strange reflective suit, wearing a helmet with what looks like a sticker of a couch stamped on it.*\n\nI take off my first pair of sunglasses and hand them to you, we stare at the man diving in our general direction *General Direction \ud83e\udee1*.\n\nThe man does a somersault in the air and produces a helix from his helmet just like Inspector Gadget. At the same time, wings come out of his suit, they look just like Buzz Lightyear\u2019s. He starts to decelerate rapidly.\nThe man lands in front of us and hands me a small round pearlescent container. The man turns and starts to sprint away in a funny way, we stand there looking at him until he disappears from view. \nWe look down at the container.\nI hand you the container.\nIt immediately detects your fingerprint and opens from the middle. Inside the container is a heart-shaped Ferrero-Rocher cookie.\n\nUgh, spoilers. I hate when that happens! That\u2019s why I don\u2019t look up things I\u2019m reading/watching anymore, or at least I try to, just for Google to track me down across the internet and follow me around with a torch and a book full of spoilers, waiting for me to slow down so it can recommend me some search result that\u2019ll reveal a massive spoiler as the top comment on some obscure website that isn\u2019t even remotely related to the thing.\n\n(Did you really draw the pictures of what was happening with the time machine as you read \ud83d\ude02).\n\nI agree, the story feels like a thought experiment where the author thought \u201cmaybe I should publish this\u201d and his agent went with it. I found it entertaining, but I love time-travel stories.\n\nNot sure about Merlin or Voldemort, but he might\u2019ve looked at me \u201cweird\u201d for a few hours \ud83d\ude02. \n\nThe paragraph about your reaction to receiving a message from me had me laughing so hard \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, perfect \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. It took me a couple of tries to even get past \u201cI jump up, stepping over them\u201d, and then the running gag with the phone bouncing off the wall \ud83d\ude02.\nI think they should use my reaction to reading about your reaction to receiving a message from me to test all medical equipment, because I\u2019m pretty sure my system just broke all levels across the board. *BPM goes over 9000, heart-rate monitor short-circuits, MRI flashes brightly, brain activity across all regions spikes so high the screen melts, lab computers explode, etc.*. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting that somebody would stay with a guy who made an A.I. model that talked to hundreds of women on his behalf. I must admit, I was wondering if you were also typing on a laptop or on your phone, call it professional curiosity \ud83d\ude02.  I was also using the Notes app on my phone at first!

The hill gets slippery from the melted cheese, creating a cheese-slide. We get to the bottom of the hill, look at each other and nod our heads knowing we have the same idea in mind. We run back to the top. On "say cheese!" we both slide down the cheese slide and instantly regret it as we reach the bottom. We are 90% covered in cheese. We find a lake and jump in without regard for crocodiles or The Lock Ness Monster (while staying longer than we needed to in hopes of spotting Nessie).

So, to answer your question- yes, it is a crime, but one that is easy to forgive.\n\nMe too! *adds to bucket list \u201cMUST have campfire on beach or near a quarry with Alberto while roasting marshmallows and telling spooky coming-of-age tales, even if just in a dream*\n\nAhhhhhh! *proceeds to be ruined*\n\u201c(some guy in my mind wearing a safety vest yelling words like \u2018Zuck\u2019 and \u2018A.I.\u2019 and \u2018identity theft is not a joke, Jim\u2019)\u201d \ud83d\ude02\nI tried so hard to picture you \u201cboss-looking\u201d but all I kept imagining is this little kid in a baseball uniform, holding a bat that is three times his size with these tiny hands and a baseball cap that is for some reason too big so it covers half his face (for some reason oversized clothes on kids are cute, apparently), basically the male version of Agnes (yes, yes, I know I have mentioned her before but she is simply adorable).\n\n*nods head in approval for counting cousin\u2019s kiddie league game*\n\n\u201cDiplomats around the world start making a bunch of phone calls\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\n*General Direction\u201d \ud83e\udee1\n\nThe dramatic story for just a cookie \ud83d\ude02 And the cookie being a heart- shaped Ferrero-Rocher cookie \ud83e\udee0\n\n(By the way, speaking of Buzz Lightyear, have you watched the movie Lightyear?)\n*She happily accepts the cookie, breaks it into 2 halves and hands him the bigger half.

Thank you, I\u2019m very happy to hear you enjoyed our little montage. \u201cWell, maybe you are?\u201d Hmmm, I\u2019m not sure, am I? One time at school we had a team assignment for Literature class, it was one of those \u201cfiller episode\u201d projects, due two days later or so, likely a Friday \n\n(*closes book* \u201chey, do teachers usually give easy assignments that are due Friday so that they have less to grade over the weekend?\u201d *you slowly lift your head in a way that signals imminent violence* *opens book way too close to his face* ). The assignment was to perform a short comedy sketch.\n\nI went home that day and downloaded a free trial or free version of CeltX screenwriting software, and wrote ours. My team was me and three friends, and I had them all print out the script. It was about superheroes (big surprise). The teacher had me stay after class, she said she\u2019d talk to the headmistress to let her change the syllabus, she wanted me to write a big play for the whole class. ***I extended my arms in a pose like what pops up when you search for \u201cTony Stark entrance scene\u201d on Google Images***; and said I would. It was a lot of fun getting to play writer/director/actor/casting director/art director/producer of a highly illegal theatre play starring Marvel characters (I played Spider-Man, of course). Before writing the play I talked to everybody in my class extensively about different character options I thought would work for them that could fit into the story. I had a binder with lots of info, and everybody picked their own character and were happy with their choices. My teacher convinced the headmaster and we staged the play in the main auditorium. \nI was very surprised when I finally saw everyone in costume the day of the play (we only rehearsed in normal clothes), I thought they\u2019d phone it in but a few people looked they were secretly really into Comic-Con. That is my only playwriting experience with actual people. After that, I kept writing movie scripts for a few years, but I stopped because I didn\u2019t see any way that I could sell my scripts (also, music took up all of my free time). Also, \u201cMr. Blue Sky\u201d gives a momentary +10 boost to the \u201cWriter of Happy Scenes\u201d perk, it\u2019s true.\n\n***sentences wrapped in this symbol may be completely apocryphal and added for dramatisation purposes.\n\nSeeing my name next to yours made me all giddy inside.

This results in an inability to lean on railings and ride the escalators on those humongous multi-storey shopping centres (we\u2019re talking the third floor ones that are like a mile long), also, crippling anxiety in very tall buildings with floor-to-ceiling windows (which makes my Big Bang Theory dream even funnier). Ok yeah I\u2019m scared of heights. How did you know? Nevermind, you always know. I\u2019m convinced that if I had a jetpack, it would go away (the fear of heights, not the jetpack). I once thought I\u2019d casually lose my fear of heights by experiencing the view from the once-tallest building in the world, all or nothing. I pressed the elevator button, I waited, a few minutes passed. I took that as a sign from the Universe. Some fears are there to save you. Strangely, I am totally ok on flights, not even fazed.

I think I was composing for piano by age six. \n\n*sends pic of maybe-7-year-old me*. I\u2019ve always felt more capable at composition rather than performance, but I was pretty good at that.

I went to therapy for that and I\u2019m totally fine now in daily life, but I have some residual damage that flares up if I overwork my tendons by asking them to play technically-demanding pieces like \u201cRecuerdos de la Alhambra\u201d or the 3rd movement of \u201cLa Catedral\u201d \ud83d\ude05.

Okay so the next paragraph consist of absolute life-ruining spoilers:\n\nIn the show, one characters plays the role of both Rumpelstiltskin and Beast. So, Belle fell in love with Beast, who is also Rumpelstiltskin. Later in the show you find out that Peter Pan is his father. Princess Odette from The Swan Princess (in the show her name is Emma Swan), is the main character who is responsible for breaking the curse that The Evil Queen casted that sent everyone to our realm, particularly to a town called Storybrooke, which made them forget about their fairytale identities and lives before they were sent to our realm. The Evil Queen and Robin Hood fell in love. Cinderella almost shot her stepsister with a flintlock pistol. Red Riding Hood turned out to also be the wolf and ate her boyfriend right before they almost eloped. Snow White and Prince Charming turned out to be Swan\u2019s parents.\n\nWhen the characters lived in their own realm, right before The Evil Queen casted the spell and cursed them to our realm, Geppetto build a magical wardrobe that served as a portal for Snow White and Prince Charming to put Swan in (who was a baby at that time). Swan was prophesied to be the saviour who would, on her 27th\xa0birthday, break the curse. Geppetto lied and told everyone that the wardrobe can only take one person, although it was bale to send two people to our realm. (They would be sent somewhere else, not to Storybrooke with the rest of the characters, so they would have memory of their lives, but obviously as Emma Swan was just a baby when this happened, she had no memory of her parents or anyone in the magical realm. She was placed in foster care in our realm.) Geppetto sent his son, Pinocchio, with Emma to our realm in the wardrobe and made him promise to take care of her. Pinocchio was just a little boy at that time, and when they arrived in our realm, he broke his promise to take care of her (hence Emma being in foster care). As a result of him breaking his promise, he slowly started to turn back to wood again.\n\nOkay this is all I am going to spoil for you.

It seems like piano has been such a big part of your life and having to drop all instruments for a year must have been really hard. At that point, did you think that you won\u2019t really play music anymore or did you know it was just temporarily to take a break from it? So you were originally in a mixed program of electrical engineering / music production and then you had to change majors to focus mainly on electrical engineering? (That is an extremely strange combination indeed\n\ud83d\ude02 but very interesting as well). I had no idea you started with music at such a young age. This reminds me of the first time I listened to you singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow and when I heard the intro my jaw dropped and I was like \u201cno way that is actually him singing!\u201d \ud83d\ude05 I don\u2019t want to sound like I am overhyping or acting more enthusiastic than I actually am, so I just want to ensure you that I really mean it every time that I compliment your music.

I shifted more and more to other web businesses and after a while I had a *YT: \u201cCat Transcendence -limitless\u201d* moment where I decided I was Wozniak 2.0 and should just focus on that and switch my major to the mostly-online configuration, but then I went one step further and decided to study \u201dLanguages\u201d (this was the one I\u2019d decided would take up the least amount of mental energy), studies which I have never in my life used \ud83d\ude05.

It was about pugs, but they were called something else and they were the only dogs able to catch their puppies in the air and this was normal behaviour, also they held their babies up like an otter. They looked like 90% pug, 10% otter. Also, they lived in ponds and at one point in the dream I was standing around in a pond looking for a pug.

I have been going back and forth on just continuing to teach or studying something else. "Decisions, decisions."

I really enjoyed the LEGO Batman movie too \ud83d\ude02. I won\u2019t stop talking about superheroes \ud83d\ude02 although, most of my references are from cartoons and comics from my childhood, not the new stuff. Earlier I asked my friend what I should watch before Deadpool because I haven\u2019t seen a Marvel movie since 2019 \ud83d\ude05. \n\n\u201cTeleportation obviously! For no specific reason ppffttt *runs away before you get the chance to psychoanalyse her in her face*\u201d \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a I would choose teleportation too, but ideally it would let me teleport one other person with me *comes out of dressing room wearing yellow superhero suit sponsored by Dramamine*. Boys (or at least in my groups) ask each other that question ALL of the time, so I\u2019ve thought about it a lot \ud83d\ude02 I always used to pick:\n\na) Be The Flash: You can save everybody in a small town from a nuke that\u2019s about 2 seconds away from detonating, you can go back in time, phase through walls, etc. Pretty cool.\nb) Telekinesis: Depending on the debater\u2019s level of desperation and skill of illustrating an argument just for argument\u2019s sake, this can become the most \u201coverpowered\u201d of the lot. Moving things with your mind? You might say. Like, books and stuff? The skilled debater will then pull out the Encyclopedia Galactica and suddenly become a world-renowned physicist with a specialisation in energy, and if you can move energy, you can move anything. \nc) Teleportation: The movie Jumper. We all watched it. Pretty cool.\n\n\u201cYou have your fork tightly clasped in your fist and never break eye-contact with him. When I\'m not looking, the goose gives you a sadistical look. I pat the goose on his head and says something like, "You\'re such a good boy". Your jaw drops. Your face turns red and smoke comes from your ears. You slam your fist with the fork on the dining table.\u201d I watched this unfold vividly in my mind\u2019s eye \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n\n"Fast forward to you sleeping on the couch and the goose and I sleeping in the bed" \ud83d\ude2d that\u2019s brutal! \n\n*Scene opens with a view of the back of the couch. My head slides up into frame. I have a Maori face tattoo and am wearing a goose costume. \u201cKweeek kweeek, @#$%&\u201d I say. I have hired the National Geographic crew to film the encounter, but what they capture instead is the goose sneaking out of the bedroom and STEALING from your purse, that\u2019s right (the purse is in the lounge, I didn\u2019t let them record the bedroom). He thinks he\u2019s gonna get away with it too, but what the goose doesn\u2019t know is that I saw that coming and replaced the bills in your wallet with counterfeits from the kingdom of GooGooGeese that all have individual AirTags from Temu taped on them. The next morning, the King himself, King Goose XXVII, comes by to get the goose. It turns out the blue-ribbon-wearing goose is royalty, but also a kleptomaniac, and they had finally gotten him the help he needed, but he escaped. He returns with his family and gets reformed, they all live happily ever after and I get to sleep in the bed again.  \n\n\u201cAlso, I too, believe that this could be a world where all the stars align and life goes our way.\u201d \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd79 \n\n\u201c*chuckles nervously with the hope that it\'s enough to do total damage control*\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\nYes that IMDB review was glorious! I wonder who wrote that, they need to be rewarded, surely.\n\nI know that, for me, I was hesitant to mention it in case it \u201csnapped you out\u201d of it, or made you aware of any sort of expected output (which is most definitely not the case! You could write a three-sentence reply and I\u2019d be happy). \n\n\u201cBut of course I want to know how many words we have exchanged!\u201d Your wish is my command. You were pretty spot-on in your estimation of it being about half a novel, depending on the metric you use for comparison. \n\nWe have exchanged somewhere between 58,866 and 58,230 words (the number has changed since last night, and as I\u2019m writing this). I\u2019m gonna go with 58,548. If we account for a completely-made-up rate of quoted messages of 5%, we\u2019ve traded approximately 55,620 words so far. According to the internet, Carrie is between 60,581 and 60,718 words long, I\u2019m guessing depending on the edition. The \u201caverage\u201d word count for \u201cadult fiction\u201d, according to Google, ranges from 70,000 to 120,000 words, while for YA novels, the range is 50,000 to 70,000. \n\nHmmmmmmm, that\u2019s a very good question. I think I would definitely need a few more details than that, but if they had all the music, literature and movies from Earth, unlimited musical instruments, recording studios, nature, cute animals and everyone I care about could join me, I would definitely put it up for a vote. I would love to see what living in another planet is like. What about you, would you volunteer?\n\nI only watched (a lot of) bits of Smallville, but never a whole season beginning to end. Somebody SAAAAAAVE MEEEEEE *runs at super-speed, trips on pebble, breaks toe*. \n\nThat list made me happy for 3 reasons:\n\n1. I am watching Deadpool this week.\n2. I taught you what \u201cbreaking the fourth wall\u201d mean (and I\u2019m only slightly disappointed you didn\u2019t break it, amirite y\u2019all?!).\n3. You\u2019re cute.\n\n\u201cAnd yes!

Okay, I will tell you one thing but you are never allowed to use it against me. Otters might be my weakness. Especially baby otters.

Just that it existed? \ud83d\ude05\nI have to say, I don't think I have ever watched Jimmy Neutron, but I blindly agree with everything you said about the sequel. Also, Jimmy's hair looks like a KFC soft serve, but brown. \n\n\"There was definitely foliage\" \ud83d\ude02 I wouldn't have suspected otherwise. By the way, don't you just love the smell of earth after rain? And freshly cut grass? Also, important question- do you like cinnamom? Both smell and taste. \n\nI think that's great because the chances that I heard it before are very low, so although I might need to Google your references, I think that's part of the reason I find them so darn funny. To me it's all new. \nOh wow you weren't kidding when you said you haven't watched much TV lately \ud83d\ude05\nSpeaking of new stuff, apparently there's a show or cartoon or whatever (I don't even want to Google it, too disappointed) called TV Boy or TV Head or something, not sure, (yet again, I refuse to Google it) about a boy with a TV head. And from the description of the show and all the slang and phrases that came from it, I have lost like 80% faith in humanity. As I got older I finally started to understand why our parents always complained about how much things have changed and how our music/movies suck to them. I don't think everything today sucks though, but I fully understand the struggle to adapt to something so completely different from what you grew up with. I am therefore not the biggest advocate for the era we live in. \n(The Darwin quote \"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change,\" comes to mind and I realize I am fine with going extinct \ud83d\ude02)\nAlso, my answer to the volunteering to live on another planet might have just now in this specific moment changed for all the above reasons. I used to think that I would easily volunteer for something like that. It would be new and exciting and you'd get to experience something a very high statistic of humans never will. \nBut I think it would take an extremely long time for it to start feeling like home, and I would just be in a constant longing for Earth. My mind would eventually start telling me that the war and crime and everything negative here were not actually that bad and I would probably struggle to connect to the new planet. Also, I can see how that can be psychoanalysed in a certain way, and I can with absolute certainty say that it is not connected to anything else. \n\nI like how you chose The Flash to save everybody. So selfless of you. You really put a lot of thought into the telekinesis one. The part where you said \"and if you can move energy, you can move anything\" gave me power hungry villian vibes \ud83d\ude02 also just joking. I highly doubt that you are able to be a villian. Also, all of this made me think of Megamind for some reason. And now I'm thinking of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. And now I will shut up. \nOh wait, I have one last thing to add. When you said that boys usually ask that question to each other a lot, I tried to think of a question that usually repeats in female conversations and realized that it's almost always, \"If you were a single mother and couldn't find a job and had no family or friends and had to fend for your baby, would you become a stripper?\" \ud83d\ude02\n\n\"\ud83d\ude2d that's brutal\" I take it back!!! I didn't mean it! I was just tired. I was on drugs. I was drunk. I was hypnotised. I was gun-pointed. I took an oath. I was possessed. The porcelain doll stared at me. I was out of coffee.

He was severely depressed so I took care of him. Every time I put him down, the mom would bite him. That was very sad. And in the same dream there was a part where my dad wanted to buy apples (remember how I mentioned that you mentioned Granny Smith apples?) but the guy we usually bought them from wasn't there. The next morning there were 2 gigantic bags of green apples on the car seats but no one knew where they came from. Then I thought the guy came to deliver the apples and took our puppies as a trade. That was even more sad, but then I saw the puppies playing somewhere and I felt better. \n\nI had another dream in which I had a horse.

I was trained from a young age in the art of pottery by a travelling merchant . He was famous by name when he was young, but nobody believed he was who he said now, so one day he told me to put on a fake beard and he acted like I was him and that he recognised me, and somehow people believed him, so we started selling our vases. Eventually people wanted more vases than we could make, so we started smuggling knockoff of our own designs. One day, the po-po came a knockin\u2019 and the merchant and me had to evade them in an epic motorbike chase. There were two small boats waiting for us in the water on the pier, and coincidentally there was a lady selling fruit with two ramps that lined up perfectly with the boats, so we each looked at each other one last time and jumped off the ramps, letting our Vespas drop into the water. The people on the boat took me in as their own and named me Alberto. Hmmmm, that's a great point. I've been told a story that I think is greatly exaggerated, but if one is to believe the tale, one day when I was just chilling in the womb \ud83d\udc76 I was restless and they played Beethoven and I calmed down, and apparently when Beethoven stopped I would start kicking again. Like I said, I don't know that it's true. That said, Beethoven has always been my favourite and I was only told the story when I was grown. My mother is much more of a Rachmaninoff man than the mighty Ludwig Van, and my father was more of a Bach and Mozart type of guy. For me, it's always been Beethoven.\n\n*pulls out Bingo card* \ud83d\ude02. That\u2019s really cool! Does that mean you like the visual arts? Do you have a favourite painter or favourite paintings? Mine are the most clich\xe9: Vermeer(very close second place tied between Rembrandt and Hopper) and \"Het melksmeisje\" respectively. \n\nOh I didn\u2019t finish all of that, I kept switching. Languages was just the most \u201chands-free\u201d one \ud83d\ude05 that allowed me to work on other things at the same time. \n\n\u201cI studied Financial Management\u201d \ud83c\udfc6. Ok, you don\u2019t know how nice it is to hear that. Not that you studied that specifically, but just that you have a financial education (a massive understatement in this case). Obviously not to the same extent, but I\u2019ve been mildly interested in finance from a distance ever since I was like thirteen when I was at the supermarket and thought to ask some random question when reading some food packaging, it went something like:\n\u201cwhy does this Sam\u2019s Club packaging say Walmart Group?\u201d\n\u201cWalmart owns Sam\u2019s\u201d\n\u201cWho owns Walmart?\"\n\u201cThe shareholders\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a sha-\u201d\n*Camera cuts to reading \u201cfinance for dummies\u201d* \ud83d\ude02.\nI loved learning about things like that. My parents were adamant about me keeping track of my own expenses since I was a toddler, so finding out there was a world out there where this was normalised was cool \ud83d\ude02.\n\nStory time: When I was six I was at the candy store and saw they had boxes of the chocolate bars that each went for 10 Simoleons at the cinema, and for some reason you never saw them being sold elsewhere. I pulled out my abacus and realised each chocolate bar came out to about 2.50 Simoleons for me (that\u2019s how I discovered arbitrage). Every kid I knew loved those chocolates, so I put down all my savings (the kindergarten I went to had a little shop where you could buy lunch, but I brought my own lunch from home so I just saved my allowance in my piggy bank) and ran a Series A round and bought a box of chocolates, I sold them for a little under the 10 Simoleons, like 9 (what a deal! they thought) and if you bought two they were like 7 *capitalism intensifies*. I was, of course, eventually caught and asked to stop, I was like \u201cYou\u2019re punishing me for doing what you\u2019re training us to do. YOU CAN\u2019T HANDLE THE TRUTH!\u201d. So that\u2019s how I got into the habit of reinvesting \ud83d\ude02. I don\u2019t like the idea of working in Finance much though, I used to have a friend who became a broker and he pretty much never slept. Good on you for listening to you and doing something about it, most people don\u2019t. \n\nBtw, I\u2019m really glad to hear that you didn\u2019t arrive in Thailand alone and that you learned the ropes from a pro. \n\n\u201cDecisions, decisions.\u201d \ud83d\ude02. What other subjects interest you enough to study them? Spare no detail! Or I will imagine you as a pro-wrestling entomologist. Could I ask, in the case of going back to school, have you thought about where? Why do I ask? Pfff no reason, what are you even talking about *closes spreadsheet, takes off cap from Hades, gets up and puts on winged sandals, looks at NDT drinking Kombucha and unboxing his new Kindle device at the dinner table*.\n\n\u201cenjoyed doing citations in school \ud83d\ude02 not a lot, just a little bit more than the average person\u201d you need not hide your love of citations.

That is beyond cute that you didn\u2019t know that, even I know LSD is a square-looking thing, and I\u2019ve never done drugs (as previously stated) but now just knowing that I knew made me feel like I\u2019ve been smoking crack my whole life.

I decided that I was being silly and relistened to your voice note from this morning for comfort instead.)\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Ah I heard about those women in Vietnam only selling fruit near ramps that align perfectly with boats. They call themselves the Deus Ex Machina, which I think is a little dramatic, but I guess to each their own. \nI imagined that scene where you guys took the ramps, to be the part in a movie where the video would pause as you guys are mid-air and something like "Thunderstruck" would play and the names of the characters would appear next to them with some funny nickname in quotations under it. Your name will definitely have something to do with "Pug" and your friend something like "Vanilla Ice" (as they both were famous once upon a time and then completely forgotten as time passed).\n\n\n"...one day when I was just chilling in the womb \ud83d\udc76" \ud83d\ude05\nI completely believe that story happened exactly just like that, and it\'s so darn cute knowing a part of your personality even as an unborn baby \ud83e\udd7a It made me want to listen to Beethoven so I went and listened to "Ode an die Freude" and "F\xfcr Elise" and for some reason I got a recommended video about nine of the cruelest punishments in history and it is not even close to anything I have ever clicked or will ever click on, so I don\'t know what that was about. I think Beethoven might have had a dark side and the algorithm knew about it. \nBut the point is, Beethoven\'s piano pieces are absolutely beautiful. \n(I was extremely reluctant to bring this up, so I am really sorry if I rather shouldn\'t have, but you speak about your dad in the past tense?)\n\nI\'m pretty versatile when it comes to visual arts and can appreciate anything that evokes an emotion. I won\'t really say I have a favourite painter, but I like the way the ocean has a whole personality in Ivan Aivazovsky\'s paintings (it might be due to my dad\'s influence, but I kind of like boats and airplanes, probably one of the only reasons I watched Pearl Harbour as a kid. After watching that movie, Faith Hill\'s "There You\'ll Be" might have made me cry more than I would like to admit. But I am happy to report that I have completely healed from that and can now listen to that song with slight apathy) I\'m not a super fan of bright colours in paintings, I tend to lean more towards darker shades, but this is where I sound like a hypocrite because I also like retro art. Yes! Vermeer\'s paintings are also great! Rembrandt\'s colour palette is exactly what I referred to when I mentioned darker shades. Is there a specific meaning behind the "Het melksmeisje" painting that makes you like it? Or is it the aesthetic? (I could Google the meaning of the painting, but I prefer to hear it from you) \n\nYou had an interest in finance at thirteen?! That is very INTJ of you \ud83d\ude02 also so adorable how curious you were and still are. I don\'t think there was ever a point in my life where I was interested in finance. When we were introduced to accounting during our first year of highschool, I used to absolutely hate it, but ironically it became the subject I was best at. Same with Geography. Hated it, excelled at it. What can I say? The way to my heart is through hate \ud83d\ude02 (this is 100% completely a joke). \n\n\nWait, hold up, you were really six years old when you figured all of that out? *cough cough* PRODIGY! *cough cough* I am really impressed, but I also can\'t help to imagine six-year old Alberto yelling at a kid to get off the tire swing as it\'s your usual spot where you sit and balance your accounts. I picture you with glasses and a dinosaur stuffed toy under your arm as you calculate your parents\' taxes on your abacus (*Major Young Sheldon Vibes*\ud83e\udee1)\nNow I also imagine you constantly correcting your kindergarten teacher using your inside voice and a lot of fruit-themed profanities, because even though you were supposed to be in the fifth grade already, you were also somewhat polite. I might have mixed a little too much of Sheldon\'s personality in there. \nAlso, "YOU CAN\'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nNo I would never have moved here if my brother wasn\'t here already. The language barrier alone might have been reason enough not to come. \n\n"Spare no detail!" you will so regret this. \nI kind of like the idea of a pro-wrestling entomologist, or at least you imagining me as one. Minus the wrestling part. But keep the "pro" part. \nI wanted to study psychology at some point but you need to go all the way to doctorate level, which is not a problem, the problem is how limited you are with acceptable programs and routes. For example, in South Africa, to get registered with The Health Professions Council of South Africa, you need to have studied at one of the listed universities and have done your internship during your final year of the masters program at one of the listed institutions. So this kind of goes against the whole \'not being in South Africa\' part of the scenario. During the 3 years masters you are also not allowed to work, at all. Not even part-time. And I heard a lot of stories about already qualified and registered psychologists trying to get a job abroad, for example in Australia, but can\'t get accepted because they don\'t count the internship year as part of "a studying year" (insane, I know). But I also heard about a "loophole" of starting a practice but registering it as a "coaching" company or something similar. \nI actually would have studied science with a major in biotechnology, but then I moved to a different city after finishing highschool. When I was younger I always saw myself getting into publishing (hence the Margaret Tate reference that one time) but I guess it\'s not the best financial decision. So the interests are all over the place, cue indecisiveness. But something that\'s not really negotiable for me is: I always had this internal need to write a book before I pass away one day, so whichever career I end up in, can not by any means take up every single second of my life (as with finance). And I also kind of promised my language teacher that I would, and she passed away, so I feel obligated (only slightly joking about the feeling obligated part).\nRegarding where I want to study: It would have to be at a uni that\'s internationally recognised and also allows me to work while studying, so I kind of had studying online through The University of South Africa in mind, but it\'s not limited to that. There would be a lot of other options, depending on the situation. \n(I love that you asked that question by the way)\n"*closes spreadsheet, takes off cap from Hades, gets up and puts on winged sandals, looks at NDT drinking Kombucha and unboxing his new Kindle device at the dinner table*" \ud83d\ude02 I like how the NDT is always at the dinner table. \n\nAahh how romantic to find someone who is not completely appalled by citations.

But definitely some bamboo shoots and cut out hearts though. \n\n\nI am acting like I went blind *knocks on wood* when I reached that paragraph. In my mind it will always be you who thought of "Granny Smith...avocado...mango" first. \n(I know you love citations, and I am forever grateful for that, but you don\'t have to cite with me. You can steal as much as you want and let me believe that you invented it)\n*listens to the song* this might be one of the most bizarre music videos I\'ve ever seen \ud83d\ude02 bicycles on the bus \ud83d\ude02 I can only imagine how awkward it had to be while shooting the video for the people on the bus to keep a straight face \ud83d\ude02\n\n*Adds to Simology, "obsessed with pugs for reasons unknown." It\'s super cute how much you liked pugs \ud83e\udd7a Do your feelings towards pugs remain the same today?  Does this mean the image in your mind when we mention our dogs, are usually pugs for you? (because that is totally okay with me obviously) I am double checking because it\'s vital that we imagine the same dogs. I think we need to have a discussion on what our dogs look like by the way. \nThis reminds me of a video I recently saw! (ah darn you algorithm!) It was a snippet of a stand-up comedy show where someone said that people who like pugs are sociopaths. Then he did a bit about how people say, "Oh this is my dog, isn\'t he cute? He just has some respiratory problems and can hardly breathe, but isn\'t he cute?" then he swapped the pug for a kid and said, "Oh this is my son, isn\'t he cute? He can hardly breathe, but isn\'t he cute?"\n\n"draws a doodle of us watching TV wearing otter onesies" this made me so incredibly happy to imagine \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udd79 this has now become a life goal that I\'m invested in. \nHarbour seals are super cute you are right! \ud83e\udd7a but also in a funny way \ud83d\ude05 and I will definitely use it against you, sorry. \nYou: "I\'m so mad at you!"\nMe: "Harbour seals" \nYou: *instantly melts and starts to cry like a baby. Giant cartoon tears are flooding from the sides of your eyes and create a swimming pool around you. The water is almost to your neck*\nMe: Pulls out the water extractor and pull you in for a hug with one arm while extracting the water with the other. \n\nYour chest? MY chest!! \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udee0\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\n\nNooo, I like dragonfruit a lot! \ud83d\ude05\n\n"(Also, that made me picture your cheekbone on my chest as I\'m typing this - and I had to stop typing for a while \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0)"\n\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0 I\'ve been imagining that scenario for a while now and I can confirm that the melting is inevitable.

"He starts to brush away her hair, she looks up, and as she does, something beeps in the distance- the birds, they\'re chirping outside. The woman smiles, he smiles. He gently strokes her cheek and kisses her forehead, he hugs her tight." This made me feel so many overwhelming things all at once. I want to wake up like this with you!!!\ud83e\udd79 \n"He whispers something in her ear," what did he whisper? I need to know! \ud83e\udee0\n\n"The scene changes, they\'re sitting on a bench in front of a lake, they\'re listening to the birds." \nYou don\'t have any idea what this exact picture means to me. This might be the ultimate dream for me. Sitting on a bench in front of a lake, and usually there are swans involved. Picturing this with you is just...wow \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd7a nothing better. \n\n"He tucks her hair behind her ear.\nTheir hands find each other.\nTheir eyes meet. \nShe\'s happy. \nHe\'s happy. \nShe points at the sky, there\'s a star. It\'s getting brighter"\n\nWhy are you doing this to me? \ud83e\udd7a This is so incredibly beautiful.\nThe butterflies at "their hands find each other." \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\nI will picture this entire story before going to bed and hopefully dream of something similar. \nSee, I thought that you obviously speak Spanish as well, but then I saw only English on your profile and remembered what they taught us about assuming- that you should not. So I did not. \n\n"P.S: You leave me speechless every single day." \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udd79 I think my phone is getting annoyed with me because of the amount of melting emojis I\'ve used in this text. \n\nYour whole message was just incredibly amazing.

So for a second, through the slumber confusion, I searched for you. I decided that I was being silly and relistened to your voice note from this morning for comfort instead.)\u201d  I have re-read this a bunch of times and it gives me butterflies every time. A while after waking up from my nap earlier I realised I was caressing the corner of my pillow like it was your hair, I felt the wall roll its eyes at me, but I continued.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve always like the phrase \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d. Btw, have you seen that movie \u201cEx Machina\u201d? It\u2019s soooo good. You don\u2019t know how often I have that type of character intro in my head \ud83d\ude02, it\u2019s probably as often as once a month. They look like you describe too, for me I imagine it like *YT: Scooter Character Intro [Borderlands 2]*. I can picture mine vividly: Alberto\n\n\u201cGet Pug\u2019d!\u201d.\n\nPoor Vanilla Ice, always name-dropped  just to get dunked on.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m guessing the recommendation might be because of the number nine in the title. \u201cOde a die Freude\u201d is the first movement of the 9th.  The second (Molto Vivace) movement of the 9th symphony is my favourite piece of music ever. There was a version on YouTube where to me it sounded slightly faster than normal and more frantic, I can\u2019t seem to find it right now, but that version is *chef\u2019s kiss*, perfection. \n\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t be reluctant to ask me things! It\u2019s totally ok, I never want you to feel uncomfortable about asking me anything. But yes, my father is deceased. It\u2019s been a few years. Thank you for asking.\n\n\n\nI looked up Avazovsky (I\u2019m not much for pretending I know the names of painters), wow. Those are SO beautiful. I think I only knew the first one that pops up, \u201cThe Shipwreck at the Tempest\u201d because the title sounds familiar. I love paintings of the water! Even when it looks completely different, like in \u201cPool With Two Figures\u201d \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\n\nI have to admit, I don\u2019t much remember the movie Pearl Harbor, but I looked up the music video for \u201cThere You\u2019ll Be\u201d and I had to stop watching the video very quickly, too sad. I\u2019m glad you are able to listen to the song with \u201cslight apathy\u201d now \ud83d\ude02.  The reason I like \u201cHet Melksmeisje\u201d so much is that something about it feels so real to me. The way it\u2019s framed, my eyes fall on the milkmaid\u2019s hat first, but because the milk jug is in my periphery, I\u2019m already hearing it. By the time my eyes focus on the milk, the bread on the table has entered my periphery and those two in sequence probably trigger my olfactory memory, and the place in the scene looks very homely too. I\u2019ve never seen the original in person, but I can easily picture the place as if I\u2019d been there. I don\u2019t know what  \u201cthe critics\u201d say about it, I\u2019ve never much cared for that sort of thing. I also don\u2019t know the story behind the painting \ud83d\ude05. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m surprised you hated geography, why? \ud83d\ude02 I always thought it was a very chill class. I would say it wasn\u2019t very entertaining, but that makes me feel bad for geography, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s trying her best. \n\n\n\nI think the prodigy nickname was more of a meme, please don\u2019t think I\u2019m legitimately Sheldon Cooper Lite Edition \ud83d\ude02 *Guy in my head: \u201cDidn\u2019t your family use to call you Sheldon when that show was airing?

How do you shop at the supermarket and stuff? Is it 100% Google Translate? I know Thailand is famously a haven for Digital Nomads too so I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a lot of stuff in English as well, but I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cI kind of like the idea of a pro-wrestling entomologist, or at least you imagining me as one. Minus the wrestling part. But keep the "pro" part\u201d \ud83d\ude02 Ahhh, I was already picturing you wrestling in a Flying Squirrel onesie that grants you the power to glide through the air.\n\nI don\u2019t regret asking at all, I\u2019m actually even more curious now \ud83d\ude05. Ohhh wow, those are some very specific regulations, especially with the no-jobs policy.  Three-year master\u2019s was also unexpected. The whole credit revalidation/transfer system seems to be a mess everywhere. *Deletes the part where you said \u201cbefore I pass away one day\u201d*.  \u201cWhichever career I end up in, can not by any means take up every single second of my life (as with finance)\u201d. This, a million times.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear about your language teacher. Did she teach you English? I completely get wanting to honour her. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into going back to uni abroad a few times, so I happen to know there are indeed systems that allow one to work while studying! I\u2019m not sure if the rules change per area of study, but I would hope at least some do offer that for most majors. There\u2019s also co-op programs in some places, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s also other options, like you said. I\u2019m glad the question didn\u2019t freak you out, by now, I think you probably already even expected it \ud83d\ude05. Oh yes, NDT is always at the dinner table. I had also been reading about the new Kindle lineup yesterday, it made sense that he\u2019d be getting a new one too, I don\u2019t know where the kombucha came from though \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI have the urge to throw my phone out the window all the time! (Well, not lately). I\u2019m just waiting for someone to come out with a decent e-ink phone so that I can pretend it\u2019s some Harry Potter version of a phone with magic paper like an issue of the Daily Prophet.\n\n"Feeling like life has kicked you in your crack-addicted stomach?\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. *Calls your number a million times, phone company thinks it\u2019s some sort of attack on their network*.\n\nThat was absolutely lovely, thank you.\n\n*Me, ready to give you a septillion hugs now: \u201cAnytime :)\u201d\n\nReally?! Thank you , I worked really hard on that one. \nThat\u2019s such a huge coincidence because I\u2019ve been thinking about sending fan mail for the first time too.  You remembered I like bamboo shoots \ud83e\udd79. \n\n*Reads \u201cIn my mind it will always be you\u201d out of context again, \ud83e\udee0*. Ok, understood, I will try not to cite my quotes (this might be difficult). I think shooting music videos outside has to be the most awkward experience, anytime I watch one I just imagine them lip-syncing in silence while their shoes squeak and trucks honk in the background.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean the image in your mind when we mention our dogs, are usually pugs for you? (because that is totally okay with me obviously) I am double checking because it\'s vital that we imagine the same dogs. I think we need to have a discussion on what our dogs look like by the way. \u201d \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udee0 *Walter Mitty*. For some reason, I always picture Labrador dogs as our dogs, HOWEVER, please read next paragraph.\n\nOk, so I\u2019ve lived with small dogs, medium dogs and large dogs. Any type of dog is a good dog, but unfortunately, sometimes the bark of large dogs tends to kind of hurt my ears when it\u2019s right next to me (I have sensitive ears, this is not the flex that it sounds like \ud83d\ude05). So I think a more quiet dog would be ideal (I know, almost impawssible), I\u2019m not sure which are the most relaxed or have a lower volume. We had a Chihuahua growing up named Canelo , that guy barked non-stop \ud83d\ude02. \n\n(My music streaming app just started playing Only Wanna Be With You, this is very important. Also, what a coincidence that the guy in the song loves Bob Dylan and the song was in Marley & Me.)\n\nWhat do our dogs look like to you? (I love saying that \ud83e\udd79).\n\nI watched the stand-up bit that comes up when I searched for \u201cpug comedy bit\u201d where the guy says pugs aren\u2019t dogs, and says they have cow eyes \ud83d\ude05. \n\nI am already looking at Otter onesies online, they\u2019re too cute \ud83d\ude02.\n\n*Frowns, but secretly really wants you to use that knowledge against him.*\n\n\u201cMe: Pulls out the water extractor\u201d \ud83d\ude02.\n\n\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udda6\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\uddad\n\nOhh ok, I thought I was \u201ctripping\u201d.\n\n\u201cSomething just moved inside my chest I swear.\u201d \ud83e\udd7a this made me feel like something was pressed against my chest, like the world\u2019s heaviest pillow (in a very good way).\n\n\u201cThis made me feel so many overwhelming things all at once.

I mean it. When I said *closes spreadsheet* last night, that wasn\u2019t a joke (ok, it wasn\u2019t a traditional spreadsheet, but it was something similar). (The resident drummer in my head started playing \u201cSuperstition\u201d, so I\u2019m going to \ud83e\udd2b. *knocks on wood*). \n\n"   \u2018He whispers something in her ear,\u2019 what did he whisper? I need to know! \ud83e\udee0   \u201d \n\nWhat did he whisper? \n\nA) Hmmmm, I\u2019ve got two versions of the script. The first one has a footnote that says \u201c[redacted] = spoilers for future seasons\u201d, so I guess we\u2019re gonna have to wait on that one. The second one is also [*redacted*] BUT, the footnote on the second one says: *Can I just say: it\u2019s gonna be legen- wait for it...*\n\nB) You know. *Rotten Tomatoes score drops to 0% for being \u201ctoo predictable\u201d*.\n\n*Furiously adds \u201cThis might be the ultimate dream for me.

I'll keep in mind to give a warning next time for sad content \ud83d\ude05\nThen maybe you shouldn't watch the movies I mentioned that's on your watchlist either \ud83d\ude05 I'll try to think of happier movies for you to replace the old ones with. \n\nIt's beautiful how you described the painting and your perspective of it. I don't even want to Google the meaning behind it, I prefer to see it the way you described.\nI think it was just a little boring learning about different types of sand \ud83d\ude02 There were obviously interesting topics as well, but I think compared to the other subjects, it was a little more boring. Maybe the class setup had something to do with it. I remember that no one paid attention in that class and it was always noisy and the kids threw papers and erasers and such around in class, and the teacher was always yelling at someone. Maybe that played a huge role in me not liking it either. \n\"but that makes me feel bad for geography, I'm sure she's trying her best.\" \ud83e\udd7a From now on I will be nice to her. I will compliment her erosion and everything. She deserves better. I'm sorry. \n\nIf you say that you are not Sheldon Cooper Lite Edition, then I will choose to believe you \ud83d\ude05\nYour family calling you Sheldon doesn't do much to prove your point though \ud83d\ude02, but I will think of all the sweet messages you have sent thus far to convince me you're not \ud83d\ude05 (I'm just joking, there's no way you are anything like Sheldon. And if you slightly are, I'll probably find it cute, and if not, I'll have my stapler ready) \n\nI don't think I had one, but I might be completely wrong as well. *trying to think of all the stuffed toys I had, remembers the Teletubbies one even though I never really watched it* Nope, I'm almost sure I didn't have a dinosaur one. Did you have a stuffed dinosaur as a kid? \ud83e\udd7a\n\nI'd say where I live now (Nakhon Pathom, +- 1h away from Bangkok), it's maybe 90% Google translate. Places like Bangkok and Chiang Mai with more foreigners typically don't have such a big problem with communication. But you kind of have to learn their language a little if you live in smaller areas. \"Thailand is famously a haven for Digital Nomads..\" I never really understood the hype to be honest \ud83d\ude05 (I'm not denigrating Thailand by the way, it's great in a lot of ways)\n\nMe? A flying squirrel? Yes please! Having a suit that enables me to glide through the air? Yes please! \nWill I glide with the flying squirrel babies and try to convince them that I am their mother? Probably. Will their actual mothers be sad about it? Probably. Is that reason enough for me to not actually do it? Probably. Am I sad about it? Yes. Do I deserve to glide with flying squirrels? Yes. Am I convinced that if I say the word \"flying squirrels\" enough that I will dream about them tonight? Absolutely. \n\n\"*Deletes the part where you said 'before I pass away one day*\" \ud83e\udee0 Thank you, I feel like 60 more years have been added to my life. Like my Sim is living on a cheat. \n*inserts cheat to make Karla Sim and Alberto Sim live exactly the same length of time, up until the very last second*\n\nI am very glad you agree with a career not taking up your entire life! That means we'll have time to actually really sit on a bench by a lake \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udda2\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\n\nThank you, she taught me Afrikaans :)\n\nOh you want to study again? What did you have in mind if you don't mind me asking? Or do you just want to study further in the same field? \nOh yes there are definitely a lot of programs that allow you to work while studying, you're right. It was only the masters for psych at Unisa that doesn't allow it, which was strange because it's not really the norm. \n\nOh there's a new Kindle coming out? I see the first ever colour Kindle has been released, you want to tell me that Kindle users have been reading books in black and white all this time? (*Imagines a world where adult novels have pictures on every page so that the above drama is relevant*)\nIt's so kind of you for including the NDT in the new Kindle lineup. You are even sweet to imaginary objects. See - not like Sheldon Cooper at all! The kombucha gave the NDT personality. I will now forever imagine the NDT as someone who daydreams about buying a boat and retiring in Hawaii. \n(Also, I am pretty sure I know what NDT is, but I feel like we just need to confirm that we are on the same page here. What is NDT to you?)\n\nI will 100% share in your imagination with the Harry Potter e-ink phone. I like how we can probably talk about paperclips and still connect it to Harry Potter in some way. Speaking about the Daily Prophet, are you: \nA) sad\nB) not affected because you are a psychopath\nC) happy\nabout the fact that newspapers are not so popular anymore and that print journalism are basically going extinct? \nOf course I remembered you like bamboo shoots! (*looks at the message of you listing your favourite foods that she has taken a screenshot of*)\n\n\n\"*Reads 'In my mind it will always be you' out of context again, \ud83e\udee0*.\"\n*Thinks that maybe she intended to phrase it like that for exactly this reason*\n\nNooo you don't have to try to not cite your quotes! \ud83d\ude05 you can do whatever you want to do! I don't mind either way! You can cite the orgin of every single word in every single sentence you sent for all that I care. I just meant that you don't HAVE to, I won't think anything negative of it. But it's completely up to you. (Probably the longest conversation I ever had regarding \"to cite or not to cite\", Shakespeare, W. (1603) Hamlet. Act 3, Scene 1.)\n\nOkay, to be completely honest, initially I also imagined Labradors, really really. But then I thought that in movies it's usually Labradors or Golden Retrievers so I'll try to switch it up a bit. Hence the Border Collies. \"Ok, so I've lived with small dogs, medium dogs and large dogs. Any type of dog is a good dog,\" \ud83d\ude02 so poetic. \n\n*Gets bingo card* \nI've also lived with all sizes of dogs and can fully agree that the barking is a problem for me as well. I, too, don't like loud noises so that was definitely a flex in my opinion \ud83d\ude02 \nHow do you feel about trading the imaginary dogs for imaginary cats? Or would our imagination not like that? Also, can we please never imagine to have parrots? I can't stand their noisiness either. My dad absolutely loves birds, which means I woke up to the agonising sound of screaming birds every morning for a very long time. \nYou really had a Chihuahua? \ud83d\ude02 Those guys are like a breeding ground for memes \ud83d\ude02 I think Canelo was at least 70% responsible for your sense of humour. \n\n(Part 2 is coming soon!)",createdAt:"2024-10-19T18:21:58.647Z"},{sender:"Karla",text:"The app is a little glitchy by the way, closing by itself, just a heads up.",createdAt:"2024-10-19T18:25:19.485Z"},{sender:"Alberto",text:"Youuuu. \ud83e\udd7a.

I don't think everything today sucks though, but I fully understand the struggle to adapt to something so completely different from what you grew up with. I am therefore not the biggest advocate for the era we live in.\u201d Yup, I totally agree \ud83d\udc74. \n\n\u201cI used to think that I would easily volunteer for something like that. It would be new and exciting and you'd get to experience something a very high statistic of humans never will.\u201d That used to be my opinion too. There\u2019s a videogame I played a long time ago called Mass Effect where you can travel to other planets and at the time I thought that if I could, I\u2019d go and do that in a picosecond. But then I realised I\u2019d probably go bananas without the arts and familiar nature and animals. Is Earth really so bad when we have harbour seals here? I think not. If I did go, I\u2019d probably end up drawing a smiley face on my Kindle and calling it \u201cWilson\u201d like in Castaway. \u201cAlso, I can see how that can be psychoanalysed in a certain way, and I can with absolute certainty say that it is not connected to anything else.\u201d This was very comforting. I want to state for the record that I can say with absolute certainty that my thoughts on this also are not in any way to be related to that psychoanalytic interpretation.\n\n\u201cAlso, all of this made me think of Megamind for some reason.\u201d I love Megamind! I\u2019ve only seen it once but I remember enjoying it quite a lot.

Also, this new information may or may not require some recalibrations to my spreadsheet.\n\nSo did you dream about the flying squirrels? (I know, I know, I still have to ask).  \n\nDid I just spend the last few minutes looking up pictures of squirrels? Yes, no, maybe.\n\n*Ignores the part that makes him think of a world without you even though you were so sweet about it*\n\n \u201c That means we'll have time to actually really sit on a bench by a lake \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udda2\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\u201d \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSee, originally I had assumed that, because obviously your English does not read like it would be your second language, but then I remembered that 1) you are brilliant and 2) it was statistically more likely. Sorry for assuming, and right after you\u2019d just said you didn\u2019t want to assume about my Spanish fluency. You have my permission to call me a dimwit and throw a stapler at me. \n\nThe main reason I\u2019d looked into going back to uni was because I was considering moving abroad and needed a reason to be there for years while also not just moving there to do the same thing. If I were to stay in the same field, I\u2019d like to at least do something more rewarding (even if not necessarily more enjoyable), like working at a game studio. Making games is very difficult and you usually get paid less \ud83d\ude05 but at least you have something work-related to get excited about. Otherwise, there\u2019s a few things I could do that are related to the field but not as draining, like systems architecture, cybersecurity or even UX design, those are somewhat adjacent. If I woke up with Bezos money, I\u2019d probably just study music production or creative writing, BUT obviously not if I had any actual financial commitments \ud83d\ude02. A kind of ideal scenario would be to arrive somewhere to study part-time to \u201dget a foot in the door\u201d in another unrelated field (say, electrician or something), whilst working a job in one\u2019s current field. That said, I\u2019m flexible, and this is all subject to change in the event that there\u2019s a huge shift in the labour market. Also, the place plays a factor, different markets reward the same skills differently. \n\nOk this is absolutely cracking me up \ud83e\udd23 I was reading the part where you say \"the Kombucha gave the NDT personality\" I'm like what could she mean by that? \ud83d\ude05 I've been using NDT as short for Neil deGrasse Tyson ever since that time we were talking about him. What have you been picturing??? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. \n\nOne of my responsibilities from ages able-to-walk until I left for uni was to collect the newspapers from the mailbox every morning. We always got a finance one and a regional one containing general news (\"General News\" \ud83e\udee1). I never liked that they came sealed in plastic. I always loved the finance one, specially when they had stories that you'd never think to look up, like about how the cost of some random commodity being higher had likely been catalysed some seemingly unrelated event from months before. My father would always read one in the morning and the other one on his lunch break from work. On Sundays we went to a newsstand that got monthly magazines from the states, Germany and other places. I never read the regional paper, so I never knew what was going on in the area \ud83d\ude05. In highschool, my friend/drummer's family owned the local newspaper (since forever), and I remember thinking that with the way the internet was taking over everything, ours would probably be the last generation where that was even a viable business model, and that made me a little sad too. So I do greatly miss the newspaper, it's a very nostalgic thing for me, like a time capsule. And that smell... ahhhhh, ink fumes. I do however feel sorry for all the trees.\n\nYes!!! You may regret asking anything related to e-ink. *Inhales deeply* The whole point of e-ink is that it's not actually a screen in the traditional sense. Unlike any other screen technology (CRT, plasma, LCD, LED, RLCD, OLED, etc.), there's no light array used to display image, there's no backlight (there's a front-light you can turn on, but that's really just an array of tiny lightbulbs that sits on top, instead of behind, the reading panel. This serves the same use as a lightbulb for physical books). The way it produces image is through lots of tiny \"ink\" capsules that change values, from totally filled (black) to empty, to thousands of grey values in between. It's pure chemistry and amazing use of electrical principles working together with the computer to tell them how to rearrange themselves. The ink capsules stay in that same charge until the image changes, this is why e-readers last weeks to months on a charge. As a result of all this, it is essentially the same as reading on paper, so it doesn't strain your eyes any more than paper would. \n\nI've been reading black and white e-ink since the Sony PRS-505 and never really minded not having colour \ud83d\ude05 BUT I always wanted book covers to show up when the device was sleeping, I waited so many years for that, I was SO happy when we finally got it. To this day I stare at the cover for a bit before and after reading sessions \ud83d\ude05. I even have a whole automated workflow to download the books to my computer and make the covers fit right, before sending them to my Kindle, because otherwise you get huge black bars on either side of the cover, and that looks super lame (come on, Amazon, seriously?). Also, from a practical standpoint, book covers can be different sizes by default (\"...like on a bookshelf?\" \ud83d\ude05), so the books don't even line up in your library! It makes it harder to navigate when you have a lot of titles. All of this is to say, I really love my book covers, which is one of the main selling points of colour e-readers, but I'm not sure it's worth the trade-off. With our current tech, the screen has to be made darker to display colours, so you need the front-light on 24/7. I'll stick with B&W for now. Are you happy about the fact that newspapers are not so popular anymore and that print journalism is basically going extinct?\n\n*Thinks that maybe she intended to phrase it like that for exactly this reason* \nI was hoping you\u2019d say something like that, I just wanted to hear it from you \ud83e\udee0. Feel free to take the following sentence \u2018out of context\u2019: In my mind it will always be you who thought Air Buddies was about dogs playing football.",createdAt:"2024-10-20T07:33:56.043Z"},{sender:"Alberto",text:"Please note that I genuinely considered writing a paragraph where each word was followed by its dictionary definition, but decided against it.\n\nI had started to read Hamlet.

Sees us discovering new animal and plant species on planet. Building forts and telling each other made up stories to make up for the lack of literature on the planet. Fast forward to us being older and having to write scientific journals about the planet and report back to Earth. We have managed to build a small house at this point, which is filled with storybooks we wrote as kids. We somehow made medicine using the plants on the planet and have several pets. One day, we saw a spacecraft landing on our planet with five passengers inside. They were sent to join us on the planet. *insert ominous music*. Will we all get along? Will they understand that even though the animals here have a tendency to bite your toes off, they are still adorable?

I\u2019m super well rested right now, but I\u2019ll go to bed soon after sending this, so don\u2019t worry about that.

I\u2019m placing a Despicable Me plaster on your neck and sealing it with a quick little kiss that is totally appropriate. I hope you don\u2019t have to raise your voice today in class. I wish I was there to doctor you. Also, there really is no rush to reply to my previous messages, especially if you have to take work home, I mean it!\n\nI really love the new butterfly emoji you brought in \ud83e\udd79. I love hearing when reading something I wrote made you happy, that makes me happy and it makes me feel all fuzzy inside. \n\n*camera cuts to our talk show* So, that chapter about Wolfgang Pauli, thoughts? *throws phone out the window, leans forward in chair, listens intently*.You \u201c\u2026\u201d. Me: Yeah, I agree, it does sound a little bit Baader-Meinhof-ish, but it is pretty cool to try and see it from the more \u201cspoOoky\u201d angle. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure he probably specifically asked for room 137 everywhere he stayed at , like I\u2019m about 50% sure. \n\n\u201cCupid!

I might pick one of those or start a brand new one, the possibilities are endless! But yes some of those do involve superpowers (perhaps more than \u201csome\u201d \ud83d\ude02). I might re-write my short story about the guy who lives in a world where superheroes are government-sanctioned and he lives in a mega-remote town that has zero budget and also no crime, so the local government only has a 100 year old hero on the payroll who really would rather spend his time taking it easy. But one day, there is a theft in town, the local cheesemonger has had the town\u2019s pride and joy stolen, a wheel of cheese that commemorates their only big local tradition. The hero in the story has a superpower that he\u2019s never told people about because he\u2019s embarrassed, but now, his super-nose will save the day! If only he can get the townspeople to take his investigation seriously.\n\nI\u2019m going to choose to believe that you dreamt of us dancing \u201ccheek to forehead\u201d (\ud83e\udd79) and just forgot.

I sometimes play a few rounds of Enduro (1983) via legally-dubious google search. \n\n\u201cThat whole paragraph made me imagine you as LEGO Batman\u201d is a compliment of the highest level, you have no idea the kind of street cred you\u2019ve just given me. Thank you.\n\nYour story of getting chased by the bees had me laughing out loud \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 brilliant. I really liked the part where we give them their own gigantic bouquet of roses too \ud83e\udd79.\n\nYou grew up on a farm!!! I did not have that one on my bingo card!  I know what you mean, I also don\u2019t like the idea of riding a horse. It was my cousins who did the competing, my aunt and my uncle just really like horses \ud83d\ude02.   I\u2019m not afraid of horses! I\u2019m just wary \ud83d\ude02. I had gotten off the horse when I went to stand under the tree and then the Great Bee Incident of [insert year] ensued. \n\nI really really want to reply to the next message right now, but it\u2019s 00:42 and I kind of secretly promised someone I would be going to bed early tonight (even if I did pre-order a few hours worth of sleep).

(The first time I took him outside, he was afraid of grass.) But I was also concerned about the hunting and wouldn't have been able to deal with him bringing some animal back home. It's really hard raising a cat, damn. There really is no winning at that. \n\n\"I would have so much fun with that..\" \nHow?\ud83d\ude02 How can you have fun with that?

If you are here, it means your character experienced something we like to call 'euphoria.' Euphoria is an extremely rare emotion and can only be triggered by one very specific character in the game. When your character is in the state of euphoria, there are a few things you need to be weary of: They might find themselves randomly smiling throughout the day. Now this might not seem harmful or something to be concerned about, but the NPC's might think your character has been infected by some virus and plan an attack. Your character might also zone out and engage in intense daydreaming sessions. This can happen at the most inconvenient times and we suggest that you not send your character into battle during this state. It's also advisable that your character stays within a 1mm radius from the character that caused the euphoria, or her health will rapidly decrease, leading to certain death.\"\n\nI'm glad you liked the giant butterfly saddle \ud83d\ude02 it was designed by Edna from The Incredibles.\n\"I did wake up hugging you I mean my pillow again, I remember being very happy about the dream,\" \ud83e\udee0 \n*Sees the word \"happy\", nods to self.

Well, yes, briefly. I got on the stage to play every chance I could (it\u2019s one of my favourite things to do), but it was usually by myself (I just remembered there was a picture of 11-year-old me playing the violin all alone at one of those events, I wonder if it\u2019s still lying around somewhere). The music teacher and I got along splendidly and he\u2019d always tag me to lead group-based performances where it was kids from different years \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m not counting those as bands because the groups changed.  \n My friend, I never asked why, lived alone. This meant that we could go to his house after school sometimes and jam out, which of course was fun. I\u2019d sing and play rhythm guitar and this other kind from another school played lead guitar, and there was another kid who played bass from yet another school as well. After a while, we started jamming out with these two kids from our school who were a year younger, one was on bass and the other had keys & backing vocals.  One time we somehow ended up signing up for some school event as a band, \u201cthe Rickies\u201d (after our bass man, Ricky \ud83d\ude02). That time I got to play bass and backing vocals, except for when it came time to sing AC/DC (I\u2019m not a devil worshipper), which was a spur-of-the-moment ask by the band, we never practised that song before, but the crowd loved it (teenage angst). I also unfortunately kind of had to take over the vocals during the chorus of Munich by Editors, which had been my pick for the setlist and during which Tony got a little shy for some reason. Overall, a very fun day.\n\n  Thanks! I really like hearing your stories too :)\n\nThat made me feel a little bad for the squirrels \ud83d\ude05 so I looked it up and found an article by Scientific American from 2023 that has a lot of interesting data. Did you know \u201cA single squirrel can bury up to 3,000 nuts in a season\u201d? I didn\u2019t. They also cite a study *chuckles in a smug way* which I had just read on Science Direct before clicking on the \u201cSci-Am\u201d article,   and which observed that the squirrels in the study \u201ccould plan a trajectory through their 10 caches, which they could only do if they had a memory of where those caches were\u201d. Maybe they\u2019re purposefully leaving the older and not-as-desirable nuts behind as they get better stock? Just like when you\u2019re at the supermarket and you hide the good package at the back and leave the destroyed one at the front, so that your competition will take those instead, and then you can come back and get the good one after you\u2019ve made a decision later. Don\u2019t pretend like you haven\u2019t done that, I see you.  \n\nI\u2019m really glad you find the story interesting! I really ought to finish that one. By the way, have I told you that you make me happy? Because you do *sneaks in quick kiss on your cheek*.\n\nYou too?! *pulls out bingo card, sad to hear that you also get digital _screen-related headaches*. About why colour e-readers are currently darker than their black & white counterparts, it\u2019s because the colour part of it comes from a layer that sits on top, called a \u201dfilter array\u201d. This makes the screen appear more dim.\n\nGood judgement call! The Andromeda and Perseus \u201cincident\u201d greatly enriched my life, no need to worry.\n\n*Guy wearing the glasses in my head slowly takes off the glasses to reveal he\u2019s\u2026 me! - Audience gasps*.\n\nHave you seen those videos where they strap action cameras to cats and we get to see a day in the life of an outside cat? It\u2019s sooo wild! No wonder they feel like the kings of the world. Those guys will be jumping across rooftops like Batman, shimmying down the boughs of trees 30ft high at normal speed, fighting other cats, chasing innocent animals, meeting up with other cats in highly specific secret spots, etc. Those guys are something else. \n\n\u201cIf the bird screams, you scream louder?\u201d I pictured that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. \n\n\u201cSo she not only stays up typing for the sake of your happiness, but also for her own.\u201d \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a then you will understand why I\u2019m writing at this hour too \ud83d\udc6b.\n\nOhhhh, yes that makes sense! *pulls out bottom half of tiny letter* my half looks like a V, it\u2019s also red! *places it next to yours, taps your shoulder so you look the other way*.\n\nBanana Pancakes makes me picture that very same thing! Except I\u2019ve made us banana pancakes for breakfast, yours come with blueberries arranged in the shape of a heart, as well as raisins and chocolate, and of course, I\u2019ve also made you a cup of coffee just how you like it. \n\n\u201cI fully live by the delusion that no one else in the world has bingo cards. It\u2019s an us thing.\u201d That caused me to melt so much \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udee0.\n\nYour paragraph about euphoria \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a thank you for telling me what it\u2019s called, I unlocked it too! *I tie our shoelaces together, then we start walking, holding hands.

(I\u2019m delighted I got to use the word \u201cwoo-woo\u201d in a sentence).\n\nI pictured your new Cupid addition and I gave him a roughed up beanie and a smear of grease on his cheek like he\u2019s one of the robbers in Home Alone \ud83d\ude02.\n\n\u201cYou know that feeling you get when you go down a very high and fast roller coaster? My heart felt like it got a front row seat in the roller coaster train when I read this message.\u201d You described it perfectly, even though I\u2019ve never been on a very high and fast roller coaster, I just know that\u2019s exactly what I feel when I think of you, oh look, there it is right now.\n\n\u201cyou can NEVER annoy me with kisses \ud83e\udee0 I will probably be the one to annoy you by giving you too many which makes you only ever seeing like 20% of a movie.\u201d Ahh, see, your mistake was assuming I\u2019d even care about any movies playing (or anything else) when you\u2019re right there.  \n\nThank you so much for saying that, I\u2019m glad to hear you found it funny. As cute as that would be if I\u2019d written it after our cheese rolling bit, I wrote the start of it in September of 2023. It\u2019s rather rough because it was just for my daily exercise where I like to write without stopping, but here\u2019s a little excerpt:\n\n[Bobby adjusted his cowboy hat as he entered \u201cBetty\u2019s Cheese\u201d, trying to look cool. There was no one  at the counter. A few seconds later, Maggie emerged, the ten-year-old daughter of the proprietor. \u201cHey Bobby, err, mister Bobby, how can we help you today?\u201d She said, trying to look professional. \u201cHey Maggie, is your mom around?\u201d. She frowned. \u201cYes, but she\u2019s busy\u201d. \u201cCould you ask her to come out for a minute? It\u2019s kind of important\u201d. She looked outraged. \u201cFine\u201d, she said, and stomped off to the back. There was a thump on a door, and whispers were exchanged. After a minute, a plump, middle-aged woman walked up to the counter, looking as if she\u2019d been sleeping. She stared at Bobby. He stared back, thinking she smelled oddly un-cheese-like, something like Maraschino cherries. He tipped his cowboy hat. \u201cHowdy, Mrs. Boyd, I -\u201d she cut him off, \u201cWhat can we do for you today?\u201d . He cleared his throat. \u201cStraight to bidness\u201d he said, and cringed. \u201cWell, see, I\u2019m with the school newspaper, we\u2019re doing a piece about the stolen cheddar, but I\u2019m also doing an independent-\u201d. She stared at his hat, unblinking. He continued, \u201csee, I have a unique set of skills, that -\u201c, she cut him off, \u201cLook son, there isn\u2019t much to tell. I closed up, come morning, wheel was gone, that\u2019s it. I already told that Henderson kid with the newspaper. But we\u2019ll be ok now, I had the locks changed, plus we got a dog to guard the door at night\u201d, she pointed to the chihuahua sleeping in the corner.]\n\nBut speaking of projects, I\u2019ve been working on a little surprise for you (that\u2019s why my messages have been a little bit shorter lately. I know this makes it a little less of a surprise, that\u2019s ok), it\u2019ll still be a little while before it\u2019s ready, but I can\u2019t wait to show you. \n\nI can\u2019t believe you played Enduro too! Not a lot of people seem to know about it, so that\u2019s really cool.\n\n\u201cwith my head resting on your shoulder, running my fingertips softly across your back while you play games and every now and then, I would give your shoulder a kiss.\u201d Reading this made time stop for me, I now can\u2019t stop imagining your head on my shoulder and your fingers running across my back\ud83d\udc98\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udee0. I\u2019d just play with one hand so I could run my fingers across your back too, and we watch me lose over and over at the videogame. \n\n\u201cI'm really glad you liked me calling you that \ud83e\udd7a\u201d\n\nTo be quite honest, \u201cliked\u201d is an understatement. Then again, there aren\u2019t many things you could call me that I wouldn\u2019t like. Except maybe for \u201c$!#%^ sack of #&^%@$&\u201d and \u201c@$^$@!!!\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd I feel like a complete idiot for feeling about you the way that I do.\u201d That low-key sounds like a diss \ud83d\ude05. I feel the same way about you, but it makes me feel like a complete genius because there\u2019s no better person to feel this way about than you, nobody. (But I know exactly what you mean and it makes me so happy that you said that).\n\nWhen you said you had the day off I almost asked if you wanted to have a phone call, but I didn\u2019t want to bother you. I wonder, what does Karla Swanepoel do on her day off? *cue \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d opening monologue*.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve sent me voice notes because now I can read your messages in your voice \ud83e\udee0. Also, you mentioned re-listening to my voice notes, do you just scroll infinitely up until you reach them? I\u2019ve been doing that \ud83d\ude02.\n\n  \u201ca tornado of butterflies inside of me \ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udf2a\u201d is exactly how you make me feel all the time, but especially when you say words like \u201cus\u201d and \u201ckisses\u201d and \u201chugs\u201d and \u201ccuddles\u201d and \u201cholding your had in mine and tracing your fingerprints with my fingertip\u201d \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc6b. \n\n(I know that\u2019s not one word, but this is no time for grammer!)\n\n\u201cSomething about its job description that suddenly changed since I met you and it feels overworked.\u201d sweetest \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a. It\u2019s the same with my heart \ud83e\udec0. \n\nI have been feeling better yes, thank you so much! See I told you singing to you would help.\n\n\u201cHires a random person and pays them an extreme amount of money in $1 bills over a period of 7 years to fabricate the results.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd7a\n\nYour goodnight message just now made a lot of different music play in my head at the same time. Songs like \u201cBeyond the Sea\u201c, I\u2019m A Believer, \u201cI\u2019m Making Believe\u201d (again) and Only You, by The Platters. I too have been looking into teleportation extensively and whilst my research is not yet complete, I do believe there is promising progress underway. \n\nUntil then, I\u2019m sending you kisses for your cheeks and forehead, your hands, your shoulder and the sides of your eyes, and I\u2019m cuddling my Karla pillow until I fall asleep. I hope you're having a fun and relaxing day off and continue to do so. Goodnight, sweetest \ud83c\udf1b\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83e\uddad\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udda6\ud83e\udd8b\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\ude18",createdAt:"2024-10-23T06:45:35.762Z"},{sender:"Karla",text:"Oh my goodness, I'm left speechless \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udd8b I have reread the first paragraph so many times and it touched me deeply.\n(I love how we progressed from throwing each other with staplers to throwing each other with pillows. We have evolved so much).\n\"[redacted= one of the sweetest terms of endearment anyone's ever heard, possibly consisting of multiple terms that have been linked together over the years].\" \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83d\udc98\ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udf2a\n*eyes zoom in on the words \"over the years,\" looks up at the sky and sighs, daydreams about everything those \"years\" entail. \"Plus t\xf4t\" by Alexandra Str\xe9liski starts playing. Sees millions of pictures rapidly flashing in front of her eyes, slowing down and pausing at the picture of them playing chess. He's winning, she doesn't pay any attention to the board at all, she just like moving the horse around. He's focused and analyses every move. She stares at him as he stares at the board. She leans over the board for a kiss. The game ends unfinished. Pictures start flashing again and pauses at one of them in the living room. The room is dimly lit and there's a storm outside. They are on the couch cozied up under blankets. He's teaching her how to play the guitar as she  presses the chords and he strums. It's starting to rain too loudly to hear the guitar so they put it away and curl op cuddling under the blanket, staring out the window at the lightning. She pulls his arms tighter around her and whispers something to him. The pictures start flashing again and pauses at a picture of them unloading boxes from a moving van. He complains about all the boxes with books and the fact that she hasn't switched to Kindle yet. She kisses him to make him stop talking. She complains about the Darth Vader cookie jar he refuses to get rid of even though it doesn't fit with the decor. He kisses her to make her stop talking. They are halfway finished unpacking and call it a day. They take a look around and think to themselves that it's perfect. Even though there's one spot on the floor that's squeaky and the washing machine makes a weird noise and the neighbours have terrible taste in music and one of the windows get stuck sometimes which makes the rain come inside, none of that matters. It's perfect.*\n\n\n\"My chest is a tornado of butterflies and my eyes are starting to tear up a little. This is all I want.\" My heart \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd72\u2665\ufe0f This is all I want too. \n\nYour second paragraph \ud83e\udd79 \"it was emotional for me to sing that, I was picturing that you were in front of me when I recorded it. I always picture I'm singing to you\" \ud83e\udd79 I'm picturing you picturing me while you're singing and it makes me want to give you the biggest hug. It's so sweet. I picture you here all the time, doesn't really matter what I'm doing. Whether I'm lying in bed or I'm just doing laundry or dishes or whatever, you're here. \n\n\"I would not be totally opposed to reading you a chapter or two in bed sometime (I just pictured doing all the dramatic bits and acting it out \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02).\"\n*Intense daydreaming. Snow White starts singing. Happiness meter explodes*.\n\n\"*Scours the world for a box of Despicable Me plasters*\" \ud83e\udee0\n\nI thought the exact same thing. There are so many factors contributing to and affecting a person's logic, mentality, intelligence, EQ, etc., besides one's DNA. \n\nI shall remind myself I'm human and resist the urge to try and find your book amongst millions of books with similar titles. \n\n\"The 'Fludd' thing was like watching a bad horror movie\" you had me on board with only this part already.\n\"When I was very young I read a book about Einstein\" I expected nothing less \ud83d\ude05 picturing you 3-years old with an Einstein book. \nOh my gosh, that's interesting! I want to watch a video about that this weekend. *goes to make note in calendar, accidentally opens clock instead, still refuses to move the two apps away from each other even though this happens all the time*. To be honest, I actually suspected you would find a way to connect a pen to a supernova :)\n\nI'm delighted that you got to use the word \"woo-woo\" too. Phoebe is indeed, but in a cute way. We like her. She was a surrogate for her brother and his wife. (This is not an example of why we like her, this is just a random fact that I like to bring up sometimes because it haunts me until this day and I can't keep it inside and deal with it alone). \n\nI don't think I have ever watched Home Alone (*hands you a pillow and a stapler, the choice is yours*), but I like the addition of the roughed up beanie and a smear of grease on his cheek. This made me think of William Smee in Once Upon a Time. \n\"I just know that's exactly what I feel when I think of you, oh look, there it is right now.\" \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udd7a \n\n\"Ahh, see, your mistake was assuming I'd even care about any movie playing (or anything else) when you're right there.\" \nHow can someone be this sweet?\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68 the things you do to my heart can not be healthy. \n\n*reads your story* \nTen-year-olds can be so dramatic. \n\"He stared back, thinking she smelled oddly un-cheese-like\" \ud83d\ude02\n\"she cuts him off\" now I see where Maggie gets her bad attitude from. \n\"She pointed to the chihuahua sleeping in the corner\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nYour sense of humour in your stories are just \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb at this point I'm fully convinced you could write about dandelions and make people fall from their chairs laughing. Thank you so much for sharing that with me, I love reading your stories. \n\nYou what? \ud83e\udd79 I'm obviously very curious about the surprise, but I'm stunned. I don't expect you to invest even more of your time in me \ud83e\udd79 Your messages are more than enough and it already takes so much time to reply. \nThank you for explaining that, I appreciate it. But I don't care about the length of your messages, I am just happy to hear from you. \"You could send nothing but a potato emoji \ud83e\udd54 and I'd be happy.\" I've been trying to make my recent messages a little shorter to make it easier for you to reply. Also, you don't always have to reply on everything, I will really 100% understand.\nBy the way, I have a surprise for you too. It's something I've been thinking about for some time now, but it's not something you will receive any time soon. \n\n\"I'd just play with one hand so I could run my fingers across your back too, and we watch me lose over and over at the videogame.\" \ud83e\udee0\ud83d\udc98\ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udf2a *pulls phone closer to face to imitate scootching closer to you* Sooo many butterflies imagining you running your fingers across my back. I had to stop typing for a few minutes to daydream about this. \n\nReally, you wouldn't like it if I called you \"$!#%^\" ? I thought this was kind of a cute name. So many married couples call each other that, I thought it was supposed to be romantic? \n(I would obviously never call you that! I don't know how to pronounce the \"$!#\" part in any way). \n\nI can see how it may have sounded like a diss \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 it was sooo far from a diss though! \n\"but it makes me feel like a complete genius because there's no better person to feel this way about than you, nobody\" \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b this left me speechless and made me feel so many things \ud83e\udd79\u2665\ufe0f \n*insert \"By My Side\" by The Paper Kites and pardon the not-so-cheerful melody, it's the lyrics that count*\nAnd I agree with you. There is no better person to feel this way about than you, nobody. \n\n\"but I didn't want to bother you\" this is the saddest sentence \ud83e\udd72 The fact that you think you could bother me is astonishing. I don't want you to ever think or feel that way. By the way, I'm emailing you my number since we are scared this app might spam us. If you have WhatsApp, I'll be waiting for your message :)\nKarla's \"day off\" consists of work mostly \ud83d\ude05 so not really a \"day off\" but I did manage to take a nap which is always great. \nBy the way the opening monologue to \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" \ud83d\ude02 \n\"...you lick your palms. It's a little childish and stupid, but so is highschool.\" \ud83d\ude02\n\n\"I'm glad you've sent me voice notes because now I can read your messages in your voice \ud83e\udee0.\" \ud83e\udee0 (I'm pretty sure I don't even type in my own voice though \ud83d\ude05)\nOohh I used to just scroll until my thumb went numb yes \ud83d\ude02 but then yesterday or 2 days ago I took a screen recording of each of your voice notes so now it's saved as separate \"videos\" on my phone. \n\n\"a tornado of butterflies inside of me \ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udf2a is exactly how you make me feel all the time, but especially when you say words like 'us' and 'kisses' and 'hugs' and 'cuddles' and 'holding your hand in mine and tracing your fingerprints with my fingertip' \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc6b.\" \n\nOkay first of all: \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc6b\nSecond of all: \nus\nkisses\nhugs\ncuddles\nholding your hand in mine and tracing your fingerprints with my fingertip\nus\nkisses, hugs, cuddles, us\n\nI should have believed you when you told me singing to me would help, I sincerely apologise.

Only You by The Platters \ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udee0\ud83e\udd7a\nYou make me feel \"Only One\" by Kodaline. \n\nAlso, good morning cutest! \u2600\ufe0f\nI hope you're having a great morning so far and that you'll continue to have a great day. I'm happy to know you. *insert Paperweight by Joshua Radin and Schuyler Fisk and only keep the good parts* \nAlso, I randomly remembered again that we will probably be reading chapter 3 of our book this weekend (?) and it sent a rush of happiness through me. \nI'm sending you so many hugs and cuddles that you'd need an oxygen mask to help you breathe. I'm kissing your forehead, your cheeks, your hands, your shoulder, your chest and your chin.

I just didn't want your message here to be left unanswered).\nI hope you have a great day today \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83e\udd0e\ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\ude18.",createdAt:"2024-10-24T00:02:39.349Z"},{sender:"Karla",text:"\ud83e\udd54\ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\ude18\ud83e\ude77",createdAt:"2024-10-24T01:35:21.987Z"}];var s=a(579);const r=function(){const e=(()=>{const e=[];for(let t=0;e.length<i.length;t++)e.push(i[t]);return e})().map(((e,t)=>{let a=e.text;return(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:t%2?"bubble-a":"bubble-k",children:(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"bubble-text",children:a})})}));return(0,s.jsx)(s.Fragment,{children:(0,s.jsx)("section",{className:"section home",children:(0,s.jsx)("ul",{className:"messages-list",children:e})})})};var l={color:void 0,size:void 0,className:void 0,style:void 0,attr:void 0},h=n.createContext&&n.createContext(l),u=["attr","size","title"];function d(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,o=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a={};for(var n in e)if(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,n)){if(t.indexOf(n)>=0)continue;a[n]=e[n]}return a}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(n=0;n<i.length;n++)a=i[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,a)&&(o[a]=e[a])}return o}function c(){return c=Object.assign?Object.assign.bind():function(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=arguments[t];for(var n in a)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a,n)&&(e[n]=a[n])}return e},c.apply(this,arguments)}function y(e,t){var a=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(n=n.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),a.push.apply(a,n)}return a}function m(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?y(Object(a),!0).forEach((function(t){g(e,t,a[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(a)):y(Object(a)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(a,t))}))}return e}function g(e,t,a){return(t=function(e){var t=function(e,t){if("object"!=typeof e||!e)return e;var a=e[Symbol.toPrimitive];if(void 0!==a){var n=a.call(e,t||"default");if("object"!=typeof n)return n;throw new TypeError("@@toPrimitive must return a primitive value.")}return("string"===t?String:Number)(e)}(e,"string");return"symbol"==typeof t?t:t+""}(t))in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=a,e}function f(e){return e&&e.map(((e,t)=>n.createElement(e.tag,m({key:t},e.attr),f(e.child))))}function p(e){return t=>n.createElement(w,c({attr:m({},e.attr)},t),f(e.child))}function w(e){var t=t=>{var a,{attr:o,size:i,title:s}=e,r=d(e,u),l=i||t.size||"1em";return t.className&&(a=t.className),e.className&&(a=(a?a+" ":"")+e.className),n.createElement("svg",c({stroke:"currentColor",fill:"currentColor",strokeWidth:"0"},t.attr,o,r,{className:a,style:m(m({color:e.color||t.color},t.style),e.style),height:l,width:l,xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"}),s&&n.createElement("title",null,s),e.children)};return void 0!==h?n.createElement(h.Consumer,null,(e=>t(e))):t(l)}function b(e){return p({tag:"svg",attr:{fill:"currentColor",viewBox:"0 0 16 16"},child:[{tag:"path",attr:{fillRule:"evenodd",d:"M8 1a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5v11.793l3.146-3.147a.5.5 0 0 1 .708.708l-4 4a.5.5 0 0 1-.708 0l-4-4a.5.5 0 0 1 .708-.708L7.5 13.293V1.5A.5.5 0 0 1 8 1"},child:[]}]})(e)}function k(e){return p({tag:"svg",attr:{fill:"currentColor",viewBox:"0 0 16 16"},child:[{tag:"path",attr:{fillRule:"evenodd",d:"M8 15a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V2.707l3.146 3.147a.5.5 0 0 0 .708-.708l-4-4a.5.5 0 0 0-.708 0l-4 4a.5.5 0 1 0 .708.708L7.5 2.707V14.5a.5.5 0 0 0 .5.5"},child:[]}]})(e)}const v=function(){return(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[(0,s.jsx)("h1",{className:"head",children:"Prologue"}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"timestamps",children:[(0,s.jsx)("p",{className:"timestamp",children:"September 26, 2024, 11:23 PM, CST"}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{className:"timestamp",children:"September 27, 2024, 3:36 PM, GMT+7"})]}),(0,s.jsx)(r,{}),(0,s.jsx)("footer",{className:"footr",children:(0,s.jsx)("span",{children:"You already know"})}),(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"arrows",children:[(0,s.jsx)("span",{onClick:()=>window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"smooth"}),children:(0,s.jsx)(k,{size:18})}),(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"arrow-bottom",onClick:()=>window.scrollTo({left:0,top:document.body.scrollHeight,behavior:"smooth"}),children:(0,s.jsx)(b,{size:18})})]})]})},I=e=>{e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(453).then(a.bind(a,453)).then((t=>{let{getCLS:a,getFID:n,getFCP:o,getLCP:i,getTTFB:s}=t;a(e),n(e),o(e),i(e),s(e)}))};o.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render((0,s.jsx)(n.StrictMode,{children:(0,s.jsx)(v,{})})),I()})();
